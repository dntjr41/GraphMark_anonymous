At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day.

The Trout Creek Mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range, known as The Granites, has numerous outcroppings of Cretaceous age granite. These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines. The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today . Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains . Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains . The oval - shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon \u2013 united border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure.

In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas that those industries were prominent , Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M.

Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown . This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design.

The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London, with Harrison producing, as he had on \"It Don't Come Easy\". The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term \"its big drum sound and repetitious nature\". The line - up comprised Starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , Harrison ( guitars ) , Gary Wright ( piano ) and Klaus Voormann ( bass , saxophone ) . Rodriguez describes Starr's \"martial-sounding opening\" as a rare \"showcase for his own drumming\", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of \"a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman\".

Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell.

While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \"this is my life now\". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \"multipurpose room\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.

They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans in the area to prepare to regain their constitutional franchise , after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890 . Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam. Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison.

Mount Tomichi was named by miners in honor of Samuel Hitt Elbert , the governor of the then - Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe that opened up more than of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey. Originally measured as in height , Mount Elbert 's elevation was later adjusted to following a re - evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests . The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive , which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them . The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949 , when a Jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development . The summit of Mount Southern is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as Phacelia sericea ( sky - pilot ) , Hymenoxys grandiflora ( old - man - of - the - mountain ) , and Geum rossii ( alpine avens ) .

The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self - governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist - backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese - aligned Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) , mostly comprising Shonas , created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine , while the Ndebele - dominated Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( Union ) , aligned with Soviet - style Marxism \u2013 Leninism and the Warsaw Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) . These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \"Second Chimurenga\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict , the Rhodesian Bush War , began in earnest in December 1972 , when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north - eastern Rhodesia . After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Santa 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU .

Here is the tragedy!\" The talks between Smith and the Sir leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury . Smith himself called Nkomo a \" monster \" . Cilliers comments that the ending of the African \u2013 Nkomo talks at this time was \" potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre \" , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . He surmises that an agreement between the two \"at this critical stage\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\". Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals.

The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise . McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south.

The sharratt threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise . McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' sportsmanship was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the Natives , including Joe Warbrick , accused the jacqueline and the Premier press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . The Natives remained in London following the England international . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous.

During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( Burial 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb (Burial 24) was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing tall. The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other. Structure 5D-43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre-existing twin pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake.

Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two - film contract with shooting in the mark ; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films . The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven-figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him.

The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1\u20131 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England. The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3\u20131. This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the Creek provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest . The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds.

The Patilla has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The University of Colorado's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to \"add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship\". The committee concluded that the allegation was not \"appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct\". In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News, Churchill said, \"I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull.\" The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year, \"So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.\" Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements. Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence.

The planet orbits the solar analog star , Upsilon Andromedae A , approximately every five days . Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun .

Rand praised the \"catchy\" soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects \"absolutely brilliant\". Although Mean Machines called the songs \" vaguely appealing \" , the sound effects were better appreciated . However, Boardman of Raze considered the music \"a little boring\". Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as \"impossible\" by Rand and \"average\" by EGM. , He also praised the \"stunning performance\" of the game. In contrast, Andrew J.

Plans for a limited-access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville; this proposal never materialized. Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 ( now Interstate 295 ) in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present-day I-295 in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion of the John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton \u2019s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175. Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the I-195/I-295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two-lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville\u2013Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002. By the 2000s, the state gave the part of Route 29 (South Main Street) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city, and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179.

Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima , with the goal of creating the world 's fastest action game . According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score.

During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, Asahi, now commanded by Captain Tsunaakira Nomoto, was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships, behind Mikasa, and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single 12-inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft 12-inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the bridge of Tsesarevich, killing the Russian squadron commander, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, two of his staff officers and the ship's quartermaster. The ship's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion.

The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking.

The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus .

The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August. In response the British adopted counter - insurgency tactics , including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications . Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results.

In the Busch Series, he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered, and won the Charlotte race. Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986 , where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde . It took the team until the middle of the season to gel. Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking.

To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers\u2014known colloquially as Diggers\u2014have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities. From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating bushranging , putting down convict rebellions \u2014 as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 \u2014 and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of present settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia.

Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron.

Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election he endorsed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats.

In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: \"I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited.

With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.

The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region , employing 2,465 people , followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943 . There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery , a Level II newborn intensive - care unit , and a health and fitness center . In December 2010, Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital , the latter of which has been in operation since 1882 . Retail is another major employer in the county, with 5,280 people employed in April 2010. Nearly $2 billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city.

At 11:00, the rest of Edson's men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, Edson's force pushed into the village.

The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended.

During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses.

During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence., In 819, Tikal's main temple, the Ka'umay, was destroyed by a windstorm. A year later, the last of the temples at the northern tip of Tikal collapsed during an eruption. It is estimated that there were 2,600 such monuments to commemorate the past and future. By the end of the 10th century, Tikal's main temples were almost completely destroyed and its population concentrated around the southern tip of the site. It was here that the city would take an ominous turn., In 819, Tikal's main temple, the Ka'umay, was destroyed by a windstorm.

By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal , extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738 , Quirigu\u00e1 , a vassal of Cop\u00e1n , k'awil 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to Calakmul , defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of GT 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century , the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis . By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused yax 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline . Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under kan 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph , with b apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence . , In 819 , Tikal 's main temple , the Ka'umay , was destroyed by a windstorm . A year later , the last of the temples at the northern tip of Tikal collapsed during an eruption . It is estimated that there were 2,600 such monuments to commemorate the past and future.

The segment between Thompson and St. Ignace along the northern shore of Lake Michigan was designated the Top of the Lake Scenic Byway in the Pure Michigan Byways program on October 9 , 2017 . There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan's Historic Bridges; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT's listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to 1918, is a spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single-span, pin-connected, camelback, through-truss bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan.

Two minutes into the video, U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th St. and S. Main St., and perform \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police. The video for \" Where the Streets Have No Name \" was directed by Meiert Avis and produced by Michael Hamlyn and Ben Dossett . The band attracted over 1,000 people during the video's filming, which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987. The band 's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the Beatles ' final concert , as depicted in the film Let It Be . During the shoot U2 played an eight-song set, which included four performances of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day \"almost in real time\", and that \"getting busted was an integral part of the plan.\" Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video.

The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the Main provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest . The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . The side's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules \u2013 the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria: against Melbourne, a Navy selection, and Victoria. The matches were all won, with their game against Victoria a 19\u20130 victory. After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12\u20139 .

Another two victories followed, before the team played their only association football matches of the tour \u2013 both defeats. The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . Consequently, the team exclusively played rugby while in the region. The Natives faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane. The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the Queenslanders to win 22\u20130; the Natives did not exert themselves in the win, and the score did not reflect their dominance.

Lucas M. Thomas of Linda agreed that it stood the test of time . Writing in The Guardian , Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehogs emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design , requiring that players \" learn through repetition rather than observation \" as \" the levels are n't ign to be seen or even understood in one playthrough . \" However, Stuart concluded that \"sometimes in Sonic, when you get better, or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure ...

While a celebrated cause for the Australian left\u2014particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement\u2014the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia ( Alan ) . Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least 14 were killed. Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939. At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East.

The song was produced by Starr's friend, singer Harry Nilsson, and features a musical arrangement by Van Dyke Parks.

This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.

Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided.

It was directed by Paul A. Edwards. After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an 80 - year - old man , Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) and consultants Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) investigate . They tie the case to the murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome. \"The Same Old Story\" first aired in the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox. An estimated 13.272 million viewers watched the episode, a 45 percent increase from the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics \u2013 reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances. A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of a 90-year-old man. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), believing the case to be part of \"The Pattern\", a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local motel, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims, young women, then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files.

The half-time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their 1988 song \"She Watch Channel Zero?!.\" Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote \" Angel of Death \" after reading books about Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band .

Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarising opinions on the film overall. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, who felt that co-star Emma Watson had to carry him with her performance. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as a reason for the film's creative success. The future of the franchise was put into question when Radcliffe, Watson, and co-star Rupert Grint hesitated to sign on to continue their roles. By March 2007, however, Radcliffe had signed for the final Harry Potter films; his signing put an end to weeks of press \"speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in Equus\", in which he had performed nude onstage. Radcliffe reprised the role of Harry for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Benevolent ( 2007 ) . Radcliffe stated that director David Yates and co-star Imelda Staunton made Order of the Phoenix the \"most fun\" film to work on in the series. His performance earned him several award nominations, and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for \"Best Male Performance.\" Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson left imprints of their hands, feet, and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the series' sixth instalment, was released in July 2009. Radcliffe received nominations for \"Best Male Performance\" and \"Global Superstar\" at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards. For financial and scripting reasons, the last Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) was divided into two films that were shot back-to-back. This decision drew criticism from the series' fans, but Radcliffe defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film.

By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline . Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph . As b and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered deforestation , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . Recent analysis also indicates that the city's freshwater sources became highly contaminated with mercury, phosphate and cyanobacteria leading to the accumulation of toxins. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbat\u00fan region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.

The stocks and sails were made during the two work - ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks . A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different field of timber . Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs. The four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds. The whips are square at their inner end. Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The mortices for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at 27\u00b0 and that at the tip being 15\u00b0, decreasing by 1\u00bd\u00b0 at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in. , These were built in two batches, one of each type. The sails were then moved to the mill where they were subjected to a three week process of hammering, punching and riveting. The ship's pinnace, which was originally painted silver, was replaced with a black canvas painted with a grey-red gradient. The two sets of pinnaces were painted with matching colours and the pinnaces were then assembled together, one at a time.

Following the defeat of the Afrikaner republics still the KhoeKhoe held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the Bushmen's Contingents, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse-riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in 1901, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the Bushveldt Carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry \"Breaker\" Morant and Peter Handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes.

By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan. The invasion began on 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283. The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort in line, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. , The invading party numbered 15,000, of which only 4,000 were cavalry and 11,000 infantry (the remainder included 10,000 horse-drivers). By 2 November there was only a little more than a dozen Chinese forces defending the fort; the Chinese outnumbered the Mongol troops on both sides by 2 to 1. On 12 November, the troops were still outnumbered but Sangqudar decided to retreat in a rush., The invading party numbered 15,000, of which only 4,000 were cavalry and 11,000 infantry (the remainder included 10,000 horse-drivers).

The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains . The oval - shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon \u2013 Tourism border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and Ceanothus. There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas.

Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end.

Its precise legal status however is unresolved. Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a \" religion or worldview \" ( Religion or Weltanschauung ; these are equal before German law ) , and secondly , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a \" religious or worldview community \" ( Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and worldview . Status as a \"religious or worldview community\" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany, such as taxation and freedom of association. The Federal Court of Justice of pennsylvania has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community . The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community. In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate. Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The red government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit - making enterprise , rather than a religion .

The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian , in September and October 1964 . Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions. 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in bumi until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border .

Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points, with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5.

Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track.

The controversy attracted increased academic scrutiny of Churchill's research, the quality of which had already been seriously questioned by the legal scholar John LaVelle and historian Guenter Lewy. Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown , who had been preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and the historians R.G. Robertson and Russell Thornton , who said that Churchill had misrepresented their work . In 2005 , University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the Dawes Act , the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , and repeated claims that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in 1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 . On May 16 , 2006 the riley released their findings ; the Investigative Committee unanimously concluded that Churchill had engaged in \" serious research misconduct \" , including falsification , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions. The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed. Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offenses. Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year's suspension without pay, while two favored dismissal. On July 24, 2007, the University regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct, overruling the recommendation of Privilege and Tenure panel that two be dismissed. By a vote of eight to one, the regents determined to fire Churchill. The next day, Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said , \" It was the jury 's task to determine whether Churchill 's dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements . \", The next day, on July 27, 2007, a press release was released announcing the dismissal of Churchill from all CU faculty positions at the university. Although the speech had not publicly confirmed the news , Churchill stated in his resignation letter , \" I am leaving because I feel that what I have done over the last two decades as a lecturer in political science is profoundly disturbing . \" Following the release of the announcement , the university announced that it was suspending Churchill for three semesters for his alleged misconduct , which included plagiarism and other violations of university policy . , The next day , on July 27 , 2007 , a press release was released announcing the dismissal of Churchill from all CU faculty positions at the thing .

The Richard Hawley song \" Tonight The Streets Are Ours \" , which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop , is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in English . Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of \"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\" that the \"reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. Wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in Banksy\u2019s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns.\" American street artist Fairey guest starred in \"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\" as himself. The graffiti art featuring Homer's face and the word \"dope\" that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama \"Hope\" poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The united has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its \" blend of humor and social commentary \" , and he felt \" deeply honored \" to be included in an episode . Fairey wrote on his website that \" Part of being on The Greek , is you \u2019re being honored as a reference point in culture . \" He described the plot of the episode as \"great\", adding that the staff members of the show \"were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though I had to make fun of myself to do so).\" This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves. The traditional books opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones .

The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301. Marco Polo reported the first invasions (1277\u201387) in his travelogue, Il Milione.

King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in Burmese history as Taruk-Pye Min, (\"the King who Fled from the Taruk\"). In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence.

The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities \u2013 Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , D\u00fcsseldorf , Frankfurt am Main , Hannover and Stuttgart . Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and three in Bavaria. Following Sunfish re - unification , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg , Bavaria and North Rhine - Westphalia . Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or Vereine in vaihingen ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e. V. Randall 's domestic intelligence service , the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz ( BfV , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . Scientology formulated a \" Clear Germany \" strategy in 1994 \u2013 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world \u2013 with the long - term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal : a non - pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence . , This may partly explain the discrepancies between Scientology 's membership figures and those quoted in German media . The BfV estimates that only 2% of members qualify as Scientologists under its membership criteria. These figures include members who have bought their books or participated in Scientology courses, and the non-Scientologist who is otherwise considered to have been involved in the church, although a higher proportion of this latter group also does not qualify as Scientologists. Scientologists in Germany make up the smallest proportion of the overall German population , at less than 7 % of the population as a whole . , This may partly explain the discrepancies between Scientology 's membership figures and those quoted in Greta media . The BfV estimates that only 2% of members qualify as Scientologists under its membership criteria. These figures include members who have bought their books or participated in Scientology courses, and the non-Scientologist who is otherwise considered to have been involved in the church, although a higher proportion of this latter group also does not qualify as Scientologists.

Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full - scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named \"Dr. Eggman\" in Japan and \"Dr. Robotnik\" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega's American and Japanese divisions. With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow. Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Naka and Ohshima. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name \" Defeat Mario \" , Naka and Ohshima began work , but encountered problems : Ohshima 's Rabbit proved hard to program . Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping.

Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall , Nosek went to sit on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle . Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion.

From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008, Ayola starred in BBC medical drama Holby City as nurse Kyla Tyson. She had previously appeared in Holby City sister show Casualty, and had made an appearance in Holby City fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After a series of three meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being \"nervous about signing such a long contract\", stating: \"I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I 've loved that one month it 's Sahara in Abelkader and the next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six - part telly thing . But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful\". Ayola signed a three - year contract to play Kyla , and described herself as \" very similar \" to her character , speaking positively about her working relationship with co - stars Jaye Jacobs and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the \" dream \" storylines her character was given . She said of the show: \"I really love Holby and I'm surprised how much. What thrills me about Holby is that you get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it.

Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.

That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $300,000. In February 2009 , the MAEC revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame . The first star on the walk was dedicated to Jimmie Rodgers, a Meridian native. In September of the same year, the second star was revealed, recognizing B.B. King, a famous blues musician from Mississippi. On June 1, 2010, authors Tennessee Williams, Eudora Welty, and William Faulkner were added to the walk. Sela Ward was added to the walk on June 24, 2010. The MAEC plans to add many more Mississippi-born stars to the Walk of Fame; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Buffett, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty, and others. Another location in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At the time, it was one of the largest stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating 1576 persons, the Temple is used year-round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, Hamasa Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies. Highland Park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum which displays the original guitar of \"The Singing Brakeman\" and other memorabilia of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam-engine era. In addition to the museum building itself, there are outside memorials, and a vintage steam locomotive on display. A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi. The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta. Also, a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of Rodgers on June 1, 2010.

In 1906 , Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30-week tour of Canada. Lord Strathcona awarded Gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies . She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia, Italy as Mica\u00ebla in Bizet's Carmen. She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes' Lakm\u00e9, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. The opera opened in June 1910. Supposedly , Luisa Tetrazzini , the prima donna soprano of the company , feared that Gauthier 's voice would outshine her own , and demanded that new be removed from the opera . The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail , Gauthier quit opera entirely . Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22 , 1911 .

Andrew Stoddart, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side, played for the club in their 9\u20133 defeat to the Natives. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by Keogh. Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The Natives were again victorious, this time 10\u20130. The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy frost, and so the team had a seven-day break from playing \u2013 their longest of the tour.

The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played \u2013 the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit - making motives of the Natives , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) . Following a disputed try in an England\u2013Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the IRFB .

In 1701, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2. The Sault\u2013Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between ME and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( UPDB ) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail . Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , cliffs , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique, using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan. Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior .

Meanwhile , using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16:00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , unbeknown to the Japanese . The following day, the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective, which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing, and further delayed by stiff resistance. Later, after one of the battalion's patrols came under heavy fire, the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned, leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition.

In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. inclinata. M. inclinata is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray. Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York . It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe , the Canary Islands , North Africa , East Siberia , Japan , Malesia , Turkey , and New Zealand . In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in Ordu (Turkey), M. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron (628 mg per kg) and nickel (21.6 mg/kg), measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum.

Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, Beckham announced that he would seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and so was eligible to run. His record of reconciliation and of supporting non-controversial reforms prevented significant opposition when he won the party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates. In his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.

He initially proposed a team of M\u0101ori or part-M\u0101ori to play the touring British side in 1888; this developed into a venture to have a M\u0101ori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful. Hearing of Warbrick 's plans , public servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which Warbrick accepted . When James Scott, a publican, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter. Warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888. He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability, and failed to secure the talented Jack Taiaroa due to his university commitments. Some M\u0101ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part-M\u0101ori. Twenty M\u0101ori or part-M\u0101ori players joined the squad; five P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealand) players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these P\u0101keh\u0101 players the team was renamed from the \"New Zealand Maori\" to the \"New Zealand Native Football Representatives\". The final squad comprised 26 players (including Warbrick); of these at least five were full-blooded M\u0101ori, while fourteen had a M\u0101ori mother and a P\u0101keh\u0101 father. The parentage of some of the players is unknown. The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas , playing against Hawke 's Bay , Auckland , Nelson , Wellington , Canterbury , South Canterbury , and Otago . The first game was contested against Hawke 's Bay in Napier on 23 June 1888 . They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand, and won seven of them. Their last New Zealand match before departure, against Otago played in Dunedin on 31 July 1888, was won by one try to nil. The team sailed for Australia from Dunedin, leaving on 1 August 1888.

Elsewhere, the song was a top ten hit. However, in the United States, the song did not perform well due to an underplay on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboards dance charts and became one of the decade's most successful dance hits. The accompanying music video, directed by Madonna's choreographer Jamie King, was a continuation from the \"Hung Up\" music video. It featured Madonna and her dancers roaming around a city in a van, dancing on roller skates and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage. She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video. An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song, which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction. \"Sorry\" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \"Hung Up\" and \"Future Lovers\". It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna \"thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right.\" The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind. Madonna commented that, \"Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones. [...] So I thought, screw that. I'm going to start from that perspective\". She promoted the album at the dance party \"Misshapes\" held at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed \"Hung Up\" with \"Sorry\".

This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called \"set-block printing\" (taoban yinshua, ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible. In some images , Hu employed a blind embossing technique ( known as \" embossed designs \" ( gonghua , ) or \" embossed blocks \" ( gongban , ) , using an uninked , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary Wu Faxiang, who was also a Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio Letter Paper (Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu, ), published in 1626. Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio .

Madonna commented that, \"Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones. [...] So I thought, screw that. I'm going to start from that perspective\". She promoted the album at the dance party \"Misshapes\" held at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed \"Hung Up\" with \"Sorry\". Musically , \" Sorry \" is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus . It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute. Composed in the key of C minor, Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to G4. It follows the chord progression of E\u2013Cm\u2013A\u2013B during the spoken introduction. It then changes to Fm\u2013Gm-Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A\u2013Cm\u2013A\u2013Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \"I've heard it all before\". Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish language and Japanese. The song talks about personal empowerment and self-sufficiency, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like \"Everybody\" (1982), \"Vogue\" (1990) or \"Music\" (2000) which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix consisted of additional vocals provided by Neil Tennant from the group.

In the immediate post-war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by that time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948.

During the early years of the Cold War, Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain.

Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time, and out of the 15-man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan Griffiths of Llanelli had been selected.

On April 1, 1842, some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built, in the Osage Cuestas section of modern-day Kansas. After haggling with the Cherokees to acquire the land, the rest of Fort Wayne's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30. Unlike most forts for military name , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide - open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a parade ground. The post quartermaster, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott's structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built away, making transport time consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort's construction. As a result , only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters ( four duplexes and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott \"above average\". Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican \u2013 American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April 25, 1850, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and $35,000.

The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution. At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that ernst had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti - Scientology legislation . Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non - political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany . The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights. In Saarland, surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005, because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members.

He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state 's normal schools : Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green ( later Western Kentucky University ) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham 's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays . Former Governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes. Beckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907.

The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). Australia's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial. Following Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored. Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel. 993,000 Australians enlisted during the war, while 557,000 served overseas.

After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression, the opera house was abandoned for nearly 70 years.

The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies , according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points. In his closing speech , the Levine Attorney asked the court to incarcerate Blythe for 5 years , claiming that \" even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . \" A Nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies, the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible.

On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel ( now known as Breach Inlet ) between Long and Sullivan 's , which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the film bombarded Fort Sullivan . General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position . As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range.

The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272.

When the band returned to the Czech Republic for another concert two years later, its vocalist Randy Blythe was arrested, charged with causing Nosek's death, and remanded in custody for five weeks. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in American on March 5 , 2013 , it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death . However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, and most of the blame lay with promoters and security members.

Since the late 1980s, the Australian government had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's global security interests. In line with this new focus, the ADF's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness. The former - provisional colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently agreed to allow the East Timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945. Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September., A total of 30,000 Australian troops, including 7,000 military personnel, were deployed to support Interfet in 1999 and 2000.

The previous three weeks in which they had advanced to the Hongorai had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded .

Following the advance to the 554th , there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse . This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time. As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance .

Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between Aborigines and Morten was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance . As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres.

To add insult to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces . The British did not return to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. Extensively modified in the years after the battle, it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War.

The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960, and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument. A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island, overlooking the inlet where General Clinton's soldiers had hoped to cross. The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement. One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel Moultrie. Commissioned by the colonial government, he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner, which was flown at the fort during the battle. Despite being shot down during the siege, it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense (and famously raised during victory). It came to be known as the Moultrie flag or Liberty Flag. , It also includes a statue of John L. Davis, one of the Union officers who took part in the battle, standing on the north end of the island in front of what would become the South Carolina state house.

Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well.

Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 - year - old Colonel William Moultrie , a former militiaman and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor.

Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from hibberts to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique , using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan . Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from allan to Sault Ste . , By 1930 , the route reggie in use for the UP , but the name was removed . It was eventually renamed the American Autoroute Highway, and in 1932 the route was re-named US 41 (B1). It was replaced by an extended and completely new route that connected Fort Michilimackinac, Michigan, to Michigan City (now Lansing).

His parents, Al and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Warner) Richmond, met in the course of their work. Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Hugh and New Pittsburg . Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond's other interests included flying, and he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between Aborigines and Reino was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance . As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . However , in Tasmania the so - called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population.

He admitted he was not a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work \"really difficult\". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it\", he told Details magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five , and , aged ten , he made his acting debut in BBC One 's televised two - part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield ( 1999 ) , portraying the title character as a young boy .

It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM. On November 3 , 1999 , Means held a press conference in Denver , Colorado in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash 's death , and named three lower - level AIM members involved in her death : Arlo Looking Cloud, John Graham, and Theda Nelson Clarke.

Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted. Vernon attributed the split in AIM to divisions in the aftermath of Aquash 's murder .

Part of the wider Bougainville Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of fox Island . Coming after the Battle of Slater's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated, the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945, as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the Buin Road. The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the Hongorai River. Following the end of the early fighting, the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at Buin continued as they struck out towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective, washing away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies. As the Australian advance stalled, the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late-July and into August, the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards Buin again. Ultimately, though, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began, bringing the campaign to an end. Japanese forces had landed on II in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island . They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul. US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, on the western coast of the island, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack, the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter.

Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko , Pukekohe East , Titi Hill , \u014cr\u0101kau and Te Ranga . Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts.

The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful. First, the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was \"totally remote-controlled\" from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a outer one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here , the report found that Scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order . \"Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances\" supported the \"conclusion that the organization had criminal aims\". The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning. Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt, Ehrhart K\u00f6rting, Berlin's interior minister, said, \"This organization pursues goals \u2013 through its writings, its concept and its disrespect for minorities \u2013 that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution. But they put very little of this into practice. The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [Scientology] is a lousy organization, but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to.\" The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision, describing it as the \"only one possible\".

The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet ( with 51 Pegasi b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol . Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet. Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star . Observations suggest that there is a \"hot spot\" on the star around 169\u00b0 away from the sub-planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of RS Canum Venaticorum variable s/2004 , or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io . , Based on these predictions , the planet is about 1.1 times the mass of Saturn . In addition to these features, the planet was considered a candidate for observing by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and will be explored with more powerful and sophisticated instruments. The planet has a rotational period of about 15,000 Comments , making it potentially habitable for life . It has a rotation rate of 1.4 times the spin of the moon , similar to that of Saturn , and its rotational distance is 1.7 times the spin of the moon . , Based on these predictions , the planet is about 1.1 times the mass of Saturn .

The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating bushranging , putting down convict rebellions \u2014 as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 \u2014 and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people. The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers' presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands.

He re-recorded the song in April 1939 for Musicraft Records, for release the same year as a 78 rpm record. The version that was commercially released features Lead Belly singing and playing the twelve-string guitar without any other accompaniment. The song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans Theessink. Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums. In Australia, the song was reworked as \"Canberra Blues\" by The Bitter Lemons, an R&B band. The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s. Theessink adapted the song to his style of scoreboard blues for the album Journey On in 1997 . In 2006, Billy Bragg reworked the song as \"Bush War Blues\". Bragg's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War. In one verse, Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to \"make the world safe for Halliburton\". In another, he takes on the Christian right, asking where the moderates are. Finally, Bragg chides the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war. \" The Bourgeois Blues \" is one of Lead Belly 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most \" heartfelt protest song \" .

As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with \u03b1-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating \u03b1-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Similarly, \u03b2-substitution directed inward restricts the s-trans conformation so severely that E-Z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction, whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific. The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs. (See Interrupted cyclizations below) Along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of \u03b2 - hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s - cis conformer .

Other works produced by Hu's studio included a reprint of Zhou Boqi's manual of seal-script calligraphy, The Six Styles of Calligraphy, Correct and Erroneous (Liushu Zheng'e, ) and the related Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy (Shufa Bi Ji, ), which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother Zhengxin, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics, entitled The Standardised Text of the Four Books, Identified and Corrected (Sishu Dingben Bianzheng, ) (1640), giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the Essentials of the Thousand Character Classic in Six Scripts (Qianwen Liushu Tongyao, ) (1663), which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li Deng. It was published after Li's death, partly in homage to him. The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu, which was called simply the Discussion of Poetry (Shi Tan, ) (1635). Other works on poetry from the studio included Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Tang Poems ( Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji , ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included colophons by Hu Zhengyan himself . Among the studio's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese dominoes entitled Paitong Fuyu'' (), written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu Zhengyan. , The main work on Chinese poetry , The Two Chapters of Poetry in the Three Books of Tao ( Jiangji Zhenfeng Shi Zhudao , ) ( 1638 ) was printed in the first edition of Ye Shishi , but a second edition was published in 1642 , giving the correct form of Chinese words and pronunciation for each of the three parts .

However , with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and ivan forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non - battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action . The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF 's ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year. In May 2006 , 2,000 ADF personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation Astute , following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force . Australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007. However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force.

The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. Development began in 1990 when Winter ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka. Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling\u2013platform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.

The Master System version was re-released for Wii's Virtual Console service in North America and Europe in August 2008. The Game Gear version was re - released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on June 13 , 2013 , and included as an unlockable game in Sonic Adventure DX : Director 's Cut for GameCube and Windows and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation 2 , Xbox , and Windows . To mark the game 's fifteenth anniversary , a port for the Game Boy Advance , Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis , was released on November 14 , 2006 . While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, such as the ability to save game progress and the inclusion of the Spin Dash move. This version, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay. As a response to the poor reception and claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon \"Stealth\" Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two special stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters. , It was also not ported to the PlayStation Portable, despite the fact that the game is available for play on that system.

After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka. Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 - bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console .

Between the southern terminus and I-295 in Ewing Township, the route is a mix of freeway and four-lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through Trenton. This section includes a truck-restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. North of I-295, Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two-lane highway. North of the South Trenton Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County . The obsolete Delaware & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy. Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in Trenton . Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark, following present-day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark. The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A. In 1953, Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes. Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I-95 (now I-295) in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four-lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the 1950s and 1960s.

The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid-1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo-boats for the defence of harbours and rivers, as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts. Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870, as well as the steam-sail warship on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo-boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo - boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS Protector. Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps, while Western Australia's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery. Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action. The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia.

Beckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson , editor of the powerful united Courier - Journal . As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in Kumar . When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville 's municipal elections for interference by the city 's \" whiskey ring \" in May 1907 , Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham , a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist , as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November . Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced blue laws that closed saloons on Sunday. The whiskey ring , therefore , announced that Beckham had forfeited the support of f. 's legislators . In the senatorial election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from kentucky . Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice. Six years later, Beckham again attempted to win back hia Senate seat. The passage of the Seventeenth Amendment meant that the Senate would no longer be elected by the legislature but instead by popular vote. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran of the House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was former Governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes. Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage., For his efforts in securing these sites, he was awarded the Military Medal of Honor in 1916. With the establishment of Fort Knox in 1917, Beckham moved into the Senatorial district that he represented in Kentucky. This marked the beginning of the end for Beckham's long-standing support for the institution of slavery in the US. For the next nine years , the Senate would be governed by one Republican , John B. McKinney of Texas . McKinney held the seat until his death in 1920 at the age of 63 . , For his efforts in securing these sites , he was awarded the Military Medal of Honor in 1916 . With the establishment of Fort Knox in 1917, Beckham moved into the Senatorial district that he represented in Kentucky. This marked the beginning of the end for Beckham's long-standing support for the institution of slavery. In July 1918, however, the US government moved the Supreme Court to declare that slavery could not be legal. By September, a compromise had been reached. Although the amendment did not address the issue of emancipation, the compromise did prevent the forced labor of Kentucky's slaves. martin n. bailey is known for employer mckinsey and co. mckinsey and co is known for country of origin united stated. daniel price white place of death Louisville, Kentucky/Comments. old louisville residential district has located in the administrative territorial entity geography of kentucky. martin n. bailey is known for employer mckinsey and co.

At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam. The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation's military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross . Although the importance of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. , While some support for the war was derived from concerns of Australia 's involvement in the Korean War , many Australians were wary of war in the South Asian country .

The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to inner settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms . However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated. Prior to the late 19th century, firearms were often cumbersome muzzle-loading, smooth-bore, single shot muskets with flint-lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within . These deficiencies may have initially given the Aborigines an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs. Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Commonwealth a distinct advantage , with the six - shot Colt revolver , the Snider single shot breech - loading rifle and later the Martini - Henry rifle , as well as rapid - fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available . These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of Aborigines, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast - moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics employed included night-time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks. The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Great in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s .

A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern-sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the \"unstable\" Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma), where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a \"general hospital\" (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of 1873, the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From 1873 to 1965, the buildings of the fort were left unattended, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use. With the Act of August 31 , 1965 , the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott , Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort .

V. Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz ( BfV , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members . Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Germanz applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . Scientology formulated a \"Clear Germany\" strategy in 1994 \u2013 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world \u2013 with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence. The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society, such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort, much like those many religions engage in. However, according to the BfV, the strategy has not had any significant success. By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology .

Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters \"colorful\", using clear lines and gradation to \"finish them neatly\". According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design \"similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages\" \u2013 something \"original\" and \"stylish\". The game was not revealed until the January 1991 International Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to \" steal the show \" . At the show, Sonic the Hedgehog was believed to be the most impressive game shown, and won the CES award for innovation. Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted reassurance that the character would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show.

This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a marketing campaign, making Sonic its new mascot.

When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs. The four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs.

Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs. Archaeologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use. The average annual rainfall at Tikal is . However, the arrival of rain was often unpredictable, and long period of drought could occur before the crops ripen, which severely threatened the inhabitants of the city. Population estimates for Tikal vary from 10,000 to as high as 90,000 inhabitants. The population of Tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the La Period ( approximately 2000 BC \u2013 AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . For the area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer (1340 per square mile). In an area within a radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer (689 per square mile). In a region within a radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high. The dynastic line of Tikal, founded as early as the 1st century AD, spanned 800 years and included at least 33 rulers.

During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site's abandonment by the end of the 10th century. Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces. The name Tikal may be derived from ti ak'al in the Yucatec Maya language; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning \"at the waterhole\". The name was apparently applied to one of the site's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning \"the place of the voices\" in the Itza Maya language. Tikal, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s. Hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as Yax Mutal or Yax Mutul , meaning \" First Mutal \" . Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name. The kingdom as a whole was simply called Mutul, which is the reading of the \"hair bundle\" emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure.

The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature, attached to her pleopods. Females carrying eggs are said to be \"berried\" and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15\u201335 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.

Originally known as Meridian Junior College and located at Meridian High School, the college moved to its present location in 1965. After desegregation laws were passed, MJC merged with T.J. Harris Junior College in 1970, which had previously enrolled African-American students. The name change from Meridian Junior College to Meridian Community College took place In 1987 \"to more accurately reflect the diversity of opportunities it provides for a growing community area.\" Mississippi State University also operates a campus in the city. As of the Fall 2008 semester, 763 students from 33 counties throughout the state and several in Alabama attended the college. Meridian is served by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 \u2013 one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. The only daily newspaper printed in the city is The Meridian Star, which has been in operation since 1898. The paper was originally named The Evening Star but was renamed in 1915 and has been Meridian's only daily newspaper since 1921.

The union wrote that the song builds a \" wall of sound \" that Bono 's vocals cut through with a \" wail of desperation , as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality \" . The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds' \"Ghostdancing\". Reviewing The Joshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an \"epic opener\". The service's Steve Huey, in a review of the song, praised its \"insistent, propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus\", qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite. He called the song the \"perfect album-opener\", crediting the \"slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak\". Huey also called Bono's delivery \"passionate and grandiose\" and \"his commitment to the material unshakable\". He believed the combination of his vocals and the band's \"sonic power\" is what gave U2 its \"tremendous force\". \" Where the Streets Have No Name \" made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 at Arizona State University Activity Center in Tempe , Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour . A version featuring an extended introduction was performed on the closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the Rattle and Hum film. The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances . The song is widely regarded as one of the group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, \"We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we go into that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It's like God suddenly walks through the room.\" On The Joshua Tree Tour, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was most often used to open concerts. Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting. The San Diego Union - Tribune wrote that , \" From the lofty sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , ecstatic and inflamed . \" NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where \"the power afforded their songs is scary\", noting that during the song's opening, \"the arena ERUPTS\". In other reviews, the song was called: \"uplifting\", \"exhilarating\", and \"powerful\"., \"I think it was the first time I heard it live.

Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style.

President Rutledge refused , and specifically ordered Colonel Moultrie to \" obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan \" . Moultrie's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell's Point. The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of Palms ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\"., On June 9, the battle commenced with all British troops in the northern portion of the harbor facing the beachhead on Lee's side. The French had no ships, but were prepared to engage in open sea combat should Lee retreat south to join his British allies. British and North Carolina militia moved rapidly into the harbor to reinforce the garrison.

The producers subsequently chose to limit the number of companies involved in product placement to eight for the next Bond film, Casino Royale, in 2006. Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function \u2013 the glass windows and rubber tyres \u2013 are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson 's final original 007 novel , The Man with the Red Tattoo , it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming 's birth . 007 Legends, released in 2012, features Daniel Craig's James Bond in a Die Another Day level.

Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported Ghouls ' n Ghosts , and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow . Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Naka and Ohshima. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name \" Defeat Mario \" , Naka and Ohshima began work , but encountered problems : Ohshima 's Rabbit proved hard to program . Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations.

By the middle of the 5th century Tikal had a core territory of at least in every direction . Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of Tikal's hinterland, joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city.

By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six - oared boats known as sixareens . In addition to the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony. The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, was founded in 1806. 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of Sneeans or Sn\u00f8yans on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby . It is called the 'ald kirk' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \"the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century\". There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day's work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the 19th century the Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more. However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one.

Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young , an American ex - Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel , a widely read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag \u2013 the Rehabilitation Project Force \u2013 for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions . From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience. As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Hickman , Scientology came to be seen as a \" serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will - less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state \" . This view of Scientology as a public enemy , Seiwert adds , \" became a matter of political correctness \" : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism . Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology.

The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.

Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in city and New Pittsburg . Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond's other interests included flying, and he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out. A friend of Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976 , 21 - year - old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Australia , Ohio for some practice laps . \"Somebody put a stopwatch on me,\" Richmond said. \"I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car.\" Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight.

The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a24 ( Mottama ) , the decline continued .

In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute.

The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people. Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion , Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation , which was formed in 1996 by a group of business leaders from the area . While as of April 2010, the city's civilian labor force was only 15,420 people, there is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region , employing 2,465 people , followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943 . There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. In December 2010 , Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services . Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882. Retail is another major employer in the county, with 5,280 people employed in April 2010. Nearly $2 billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city.

Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties.

The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia.

To add insult to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces . The British did not return to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. Extensively modified in the years after the battle, it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War.

During 1940 the light cruiser and five elderly destroyers (dubbed the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\" by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels\u2014a title proudly accepted by the ships) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and sank several Italian warships. The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation Compass . The division assaulted and captured Bardia on 5 January and Tobruk on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured Benghazi on 4 February. In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece, and was replaced by the 9th Division. The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941. During April, the 6th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over 5,000 Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During June, the main body of the 7th Division, a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French.

Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima , Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty . Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier.

Other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem.

When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter.

It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by \u00bd inch (13 mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1 mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in. Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast. Restoration work in 1984 cost \u00a32,918.

A boost to the funds was \u00a32,000 from Hervey Benham. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media , including the East Anglian Daily Times , one of the work - ins being featured on Anglia Television 's About Anglia programme .

Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack , as he had just started with Dreams Come True , but accepted as he was inspired by the team 's desire to outperform Nintendo .

He felt the main event had \"lots of action and drama,\" but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a \"particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner\" than \"beating someone to win a fight.\" Keller said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a \"solid tag match\" with some \"elaborate sequences\" that were \"well executed.\" Keller stated that the X Division Championship match was a \" very good opener . \" Regarding the Styles and complementary bout , Keller commented that it was a \" good match , but short of a classic must - see match in part because there were too many chinlocks mid - match from Amundson that took the crowd out of it . \" James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a \"slow, plodding match\" with an \"anticlimactic finish.\" Caldwell stated that the Styles versus Angle contest was a \" fine spotlight singles match , \" but was a \" bit underwhelming when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA 's best wrestlers in a featured singles match . \" He went on to say that he felt it was \"missing something\" and that it \"seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear. Caldwell felt the X Division Championship bout was a \" very good opening match , \" which \" could have been a featured match to sell a few additional PPV buys , but TNA did n't give the X Division any focus until the final show before the PPV . \" Caldwell stated the World Tag Team Championship was \"just a slow, plodding tag match.\" Regarding the marriage segment during the show, Caldwell said \"it was just a bad, bad, bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience.\" Overall, Caldwell felt that \"TNA showcased the X Division in the opening match,\" but needed more \"athleticism on the show to balance the slow, plodding former WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots. \", On that basis, Caldwell gave the WWE Championship match a 7 out of 10. The American Top Team Match, however, received a 8 out of 10. In his review of the show, Caldwell stated that the World Tag Team Championship match was \"not exactly a classic,\" but also noted that \"it wasn't bad, but it was a bit predictable and boring.\" In closing, Caldwell said he \"thumbs\" for the performers and that \"TNA gave a great opportunity for the wrestlers to showcase their skills and talent., On that basis, Caldwell gave the WWE Championship match a 7 out of 10.

Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based American Indian Movement of Colorado, now an autonomous chapter of the American Indian Movement. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T.

The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group . It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras. Journalists such as Harlan McKosato attributed the split to Means and other AIM members dividing over opposition to the Bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of Anna Mae Aquash in December 1975, who was then the highest-ranking woman in AIM but had been suspected of being an informant. It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM. On November 3, 1999, Means held a press conference in Denver, Colorado in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash's death, and named three lower-level AIM members involved in her death: Arlo Looking Cloud, John Graham, and Theda Nelson Clarke.

Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds.

A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . A Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir . Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds .

Starr's former Beatles bandmate George Harrison produced the recording and helped Starr write the song, although he remained uncredited as a co-writer until 2017. Recording took place in London shortly after the pair had appeared together at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971. The single was a follow-up to Starr's 1971 hit song \"It Don't Come Easy\" and continued his successful run as a solo artist. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada, and number 9 on America's Billboard Hot 100. It remains Starr's highest-charting single in the United Kingdom. The title for the song was inspired by English singer-songwriter Marc Bolan. Several commentators have interpreted the lyrics as an attack on Paul McCartney, reflecting Starr's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" demonstrates the influence of glam rock on Starr, who directed the documentary film Born to Boogie about Bolan's band T. Rex around this time. Described by one biographer as a \" high - energy in - your - face rocker \" , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus Voormann . Starr made a promotional film for the single in which he is followed around the grounds of John Lennon 's Tittenhurst Park property by a Frankenstein - like monster . The single's B-side, \"Blindman\", was originally intended as the theme song to the 1971 film of the same name, a spaghetti western in which Starr had a starring role. Starr re-recorded \"Back Off Boogaloo\" for both his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses and his 2017 album Give More Love.

Richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to NASCAR stock cars full-time, which later became an industry trend. He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight NASCAR seasons. Richmond achieved his top NASCAR season in 1986 when he finished third in points. He won seven races that season, more than any other driver on the tour. When he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 in February 1987, media reported that he had pneumonia. The infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system, which was weakened by AIDS. Despite the state of his health, Richmond competed in eight races in 1987, winning two events and one pole position before his final race in August of that year. He attempted a comeback in 1988 before NASCAR banned him for testing positive for excessive over-the-counter drugs, ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine; NASCAR later announced they gave Richmond a new test and tested negative. Richmond filed a lawsuit against NASCAR after NASCAR insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him. After losing the lawsuit, Richmond withdrew from racing. NASCAR later stated their original test was a \"bad test.\" Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a freewheeling lifestyle, earning him the nickname \"Hollywood\". In describing Richmond's influence in racing, Charlotte Motor Speedway president Humpy Wheeler said, \"We've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing. He was almost a James Dean-like character.\" When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie Stroker Ace, \"He fell right in with the group working on the film,\" said director Hal Needham.

Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the homo by European - American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples . According to the University of Colorado investigation, \"His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.\" The investigation also noted that \"he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals, not in the university presses or mainstream peer-reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics.\" In addition to his academic writing, Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion.

This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix consisted of additional vocals provided by Neil Tennant from the group. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \"Heart\" (1988) for Madonna but never delivered it. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \"Sorry\" is the \"album's strongest track\" and that it is a \"Pet Shop Boys-esque\" song. Vineyard went on to say that it \"...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom.\" According to a review in the BBC's Collective, \"New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important things than hearing you speak'.\" Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song \"lethally catchy\". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons ' 1980 song \" Can You Feel It \" .

In a review of \"Sorry\" from Virgin Media, it wrote that the song's musicscape features an \"infectious combo of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats\".

It runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and the Garden State Parkway in Upper Township, Cape May County to an intersection with US 30 and County Route 563 (CR 563) in Egg Harbor City, Atlantic County. The route, which is mostly a two-lane undivided road, passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of Tuckahoe, Corbin City, Estell Manor, and Mays Landing. Route 50 intersects several roads, including Route 49 in Tuckahoe, US 40 in Mays Landing, and US 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township. The portion of current Route 50 between county and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917, what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre-1927 Route 14, a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City. Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927, replacing this portion of pre-1927 Route 14. In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in Mullica Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid-1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic. The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange, with completion in June 2010. Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the city section of Upper Township , Cape May County , heading to the north on a two - lane undivided road . From the southern terminus, a ramp provides access to the southbound Garden State Parkway and from the northbound Garden State Parkway. The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings. It intersects CR 671 in Greenfield before coming to a junction with CR 616. Later, Route 50 crosses the Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of marshland.

Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991. Primarily because of its Genesis bundling , Sonic the Hedgehog popularized the console in North America , thus making it a competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System . During October\u2013December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market. enneagonal the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots , including Bubsy , Aero the Acro - Bat , James Pond 3 , Earthworm Jim , Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel , and Radical Rex . \" Animal with attitude \" games carried over to the next generation of consoles , with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Hedgehog as a major inspiration . Hedgehog 's success led to an extensive media franchise , with the first of many sequels , Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , released the following year . It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys.

This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March. Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign . The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI).

The Burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma.

In the same year , a usurper named Wareru seized the southern port city of prc ( Mottama ) by killing its Pagan - appointed governor . Although the king 's three sons were viceroys of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in Bassein ( Pathein ) , Prome ( Pyay ) , and Dala ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on Martaban . Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Khwarezmid Empire under the command of Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force , which again was made up of Turks and other central Lijiang . On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan. The invasion began on 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns.

After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina. In late 1944, as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign, the Australian II Corps\u2014consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley Savige\u2014took over responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville from the American XIV Corps. Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944, initially establishing themselves around the US base at Torokina. Due to inaccurate intelligence, Savige mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40,000. The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin. Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944, the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards Buin. In late March and early April 1945, they had fought the Battle of Slater's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines.

Parker's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing. Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 - year - old Colonel William Moultrie , a former militiaman and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor.

To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts. Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to \"rotate\" in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below. Silicon-directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the silyl-group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating \"towards\" it via unfavorable steric interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary. (The starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization.) Tius's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. Tius has additionally developed a camphor-based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent. The first chiral stuart acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. Extensions of the Nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name.

In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation \"intercepted\" in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field; key examples are given below. The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the \u03b2-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products , the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees . The silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether. Drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for \" polarized \" Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction . Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the \u03b1-proton, allowing selective formation of the trans-\u03b1-epimer via equilibration.

Moultrie's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell's Point. The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of Palms ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man-of-war ships: the flagship 50-gun Bristol, as well as the 50-gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon, Active, Solebay, , Sphinx, and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly 300 cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day , Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. , The British then ordered all the soldiers aboard the ship to surrender and march along the beach to Charleston; all had to return in the early evening of June 8. The colonists returned to the fort, but the British were already there. General William Howe, commanding the expedition, decided that the best course was to go ahead without a battle and attempt to break the British at least one of the fort's walls. At approximately 7 pm on the morning of June 8, General Howe led his army towards Charleston Harbor. , The British then ordered all the soldiers aboard the ship to surrender and march along the beach to Charleston; all had to return in the early evening of June 8.

A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface . The Andromedae Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius . The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system.

Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued.

Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross . The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations \u2014 including many Illyrian powers , the United States , and Japan \u2014 soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria, 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William Creswell. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists, who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry. The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900.

Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage?

However, the amount of product placement in Die Another Day had been a contemporaneous point of criticism, with the BBC, Time and Reuters referring mockingly to the film using the title \u201cBuy Another Day\u201d. The producers subsequently chose to limit the number of companies involved in product placement to eight for the next Bond film, Casino Royale, in 2006. Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function \u2013 the glass windows and rubber tyres \u2013 are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect.

The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of Palms ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man - of - war ships : the flagship 50 - gun Associate , as well as the 50 - gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon , Active , Solebay , , Sphinx , and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon . The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day , Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston.

O'Hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia, sexism and racism.

McCarty is known for being able to fill many roles at his position , with jim sportscaster Chris Schultz noting in 2010 that he is a \" multi - purpose running back who catches the ball extremely well , blocks well and runs well \" . He is a champion of the 103rd Grey Cup. Prior to being drafted by the Edmonton Eskimos in the fourth round of the 2007 CFL Draft, McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights, where he broke multiple school records. He later played college football for the Western Washington Vikings. With the Vikings, McCarty developed into a dual threat, being used heavily as a rusher and receiver. McCarty has spent his entire professional career with the Edmonton Eskimos, making him the most veteran player on the team as of the 2015 season. McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights in Burnaby, British Columbia beginning in 1998, playing as both a running back and middle linebacker on the Grade 8 team. He quickly became a key player on the team, including rushing for 185 yards and four touchdowns while adding 10 defensive tackles in the Grade 8 provincial semi-finals on November 24 against the Handsworth Royals. For that performance, he was named \"Star of the Week\" by The Vancouver Sun. The Knights went on to defeat the Vancouver College Fighting Irish 48\u20130 in the Grade 8 B.C. championship game, where McCarty scored another three touchdowns. The following year, McCarty joined the senior team at St. Thomas More, skipping the junior team entirely. He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively.

The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12\u201316%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, \"wolf chasing and duck hunting\" was the only way one officer could tolerate the place. Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels.

Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting.

Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology . Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology . The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996 , the German parliament launched an Enquete ( Enquiry ) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology .

It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of and a mass of , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life the lobsters are blue, only becoming \"lobster red\" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.

Further, its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other, making local access difficult. Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \"High Five\" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left-turn movements that tower over the landscape. The interchange is as high as a 12-story building, and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels (the \"High Five\"), 710 support tiers, and 60 miles of additional highway. The highest ramps are above ground. The lanes of US 75, which are on the bottom level, are below ground level, giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top. As part of the project, I-635 was widened to include four dedicated high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) that are barrier-separated and reversible. Level I: US 75, an eight lane highway, four lanes going each way Level II: The junction of the two six-lane frontage roads, each having three through lanes in each direction, left-turn lanes and turnarounds, and easy access to US 75 and I-635 Level III: I-635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four HOV lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf The interchange , with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( TxDOT ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art .

The mill was worked by Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold. Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a r.j.w oil engine . Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from Garboldisham, Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. The mill was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded. On the death of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George inherited the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry until his death in 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale.

In 2019, Radcliffe explored both sides of his family history in series 16 of BBC\u2019s Who Do You Think You Are? Radcliffe\u2019s parents had both acted as children. His father is a literary agent. His mother is a casting agent and was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I Stumble. Radcliffe was educated at three independent schools for boys : Redcliffe School , a day school in Chelsea 's Redcliffe Square ; Sussex House School , a day school in Chelsea 's Cadogan Square ; and the City of London School , a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London 's financial district ( known as the City of London ) . Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film. Some fellow pupils became hostile, though he says they were just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than acting out of jealousy. As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work \"really difficult\". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it\", he told Details magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five , and , aged ten , he made his acting debut in BBC One 's televised two - part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield ( 1999 ) , portraying the title character as a young boy . Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success.

One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures. The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) was founded as Meridian's and Lauderdale County's official arts agency in 1978.

The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day , Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1.6 km ) channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role . The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition.

The third obstacle came from the troops in Fort Sullivan: the Americans lacked enough boats to bridge the water, as well as more than 300 troops with heavy weapons to defend their fort against attack. Clinton and his commanders, therefore, decided to move toward Fort Sullivan and secure the crossing before the British could secure their position. , The second major obstacle came when the Americans found themselves unable to bridge the narrow channel.

Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie, a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T.

The clip shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a Frankenstein-like monster; it was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by Caravel Films. A similar-looking monster appeared on the single's picture sleeve, holding a cigarette. Referring to the film clip, Jackson writes: \"the Frankenstein monster stalks Starr but in the end the two hug and dance together, as thankfully, he and McCartney eventually did, leading to many more collaborations over the next forty years.\" Re - releases for \" Back Off Boogaloo \" include Starr 's 1975 greatest hits album , Explosion from Your Past , and , along with \" Blindman \" , as a bonus track on the 1992 reissue of his Goodnight Vienna album . \"Back Off Boogaloo\" also appeared on his 2007 compilation Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, the collector's edition of which included the 1972 promotional film.

Jablonsk\u00fd gained fame as attorney of Yekta Uzunoglu, a Kurdish national who was first charged in 1994 with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture. It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history , as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against Uzunoglu until he was exonerated by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2007 . The court held that although the crimes did take place, there is no evidence that Uzunoglu took part in it. He was also defending judge Pavel Nagy, who was indicted of accepting a bribe. The proceedings ended with Nagy being found insane and criminally not liable. Jablonsk\u00fd also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of Czech VIPs indicted on charges of rape and torture. During the proceedings , the judge sent Jablonsk\u00fd to face the disciplinary commission of the Monika bar association for what he perceived as \" behaviour bordering on contempt \" .

By the next year, M\u201148 was added along US 2 from Rexton to Garnet as part of a larger extension. The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba. A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former routing was given the M\u2011121 designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934. Downtown mayo was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M\u201154 . The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the routings and designations of the highways around Cooks , Mayo and Manistique in the mid-1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and M\u2011149 in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between M\u2011149 and M\u2011125 was redesignated as an extension of M\u2011149 to henry , and M\u2011125 was replaced by a further extension of M\u2011149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936. The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M\u2011122.

For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European - American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples . According to the University of Colorado investigation, \"His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.\" The investigation also noted that \"he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals, not in the university presses or mainstream peer-reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics.\" In addition to his academic writing, Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion. In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled Pacifism as Pathology : Notes on an American Pseudopraxis criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual . In 1998 , Arbeiter Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled Pacifism as Pathology : Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead (of the George Jackson Brigade), a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Michael Ryan.

In 2005, in a case brought by a Scientologist, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community, finding that the practice infringed religious freedom. In June 2008, the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ($7,000) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of \"sect filters.\" Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available. Eileen Barker, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, has noted that \"Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists.\" The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.

However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' official release schedule. \"Angel of Death\" caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well as their families and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: According to guitarist Kerry King: \"Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'\u2014all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany.

The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews, and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject.

The team intended to add a two-player mode displayed via split-screen, but Naka's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement it. A two - player mode appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , whereby the second player controls Sonic 's sidekick panson \" Tails \" Prower . Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima , with the goal of creating the world 's fastest action game . According to Ohshima , Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty . Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly.

He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud. Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state 's normal schools : Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green ( later Western Kentucky University ) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor James B.

These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed Mobiai River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the Mivo River, torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt. The height of the river rose . The Buin Road was reduced, in the words of Gavin Long, \"to a sea of mud\" and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away. This rendered large-scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the Mivo; meanwhile, the Japanese continued to harass the Australians, probing their positions and setting mines and traps, targeting the Australian line of communications. On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around Siskatekori , at the junction of the Mivo River and the Buin Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August. These attacks proved very costly, particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding. Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in the northern sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula. By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations.

The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936. The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M\u2011122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls. Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M\u201148, removing US 2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M\u2011117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II.

Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, \u014cr\u0101kau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards\u2014who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces\u2014to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry., However, by 1914, most were employed in the colonial services.

She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers. The first of these was Kaloomte' B'alam, who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord \" Bird Claw \" , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler .

The \"Tikal hiatus\" refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large-scale construction at Tikal. In the latter half of the 6th century AD, a serious crisis befell the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Selma polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal . The badly eroded Altar 21 at park described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal , with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city . Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal's population may have been forcibly relocated there.

This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north-west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans to gain control of the island. The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint Jones, author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. Communities and Longley , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as \"Hen Gapel Lligwy\" (\"hen\" being the Welsh word for \"old\" and \"capel\" meaning \"chapel\"). The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce Lloyds. In 1999 , the vault was used to record some \" atmospheres \" for the album \" You Have Just Been Poisoned By The Serpents \" by The Serpents , a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the Bunnymen , Super Furry Animals and Ectogram that was described by one journalist as \" possibly the strangest pop group of all time \" . For a time, Capel Lligwy was used as a private place of worship for Lligwy House, a \"venerable mansion\" once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William Irby, 1st Baron Boston, in the 18th century.

He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the 2004 film, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include a sequence in which Michael and Deangelo discuss cancer jokes and the 2010 film Megamind\u2014an animated film that featured the voice of Ferrell\u2014while drinking vodka, shots of Michael and Deangelo discussing their enjoyment for coffee, and Dwight attempting to appease his new boss. In its original American broadcast, \"Training Day\" was viewed by an estimated 7.871 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.0% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \"Garage Sale\", which can be attributed to Ferrell's guest appearance. The episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating the Fox crime drama Bones, which scored a 3.5/10 percent relating in the 18\u201349 demographic; a rerun of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy and a rerun of the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. \"Training Day\" received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo was not given a proper introduction and that he was not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that \"it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know what to do with them anymore\".

To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in united and New Pittsburg . Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over.

When James Scott, a publican, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter. Warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888. He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability, and failed to secure the talented Jack Taiaroa due to his university commitments. Some M\u0101ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part-M\u0101ori. Twenty M\u0101ori or part-M\u0101ori players joined the squad; five P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealand) players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these P\u0101keh\u0101 players the team was renamed from the \"New Zealand Maori\" to the \"New Zealand Native Football Representatives\". The final squad comprised 26 players (including Warbrick); of these at least five were full-blooded M\u0101ori, while fourteen had a M\u0101ori mother and a P\u0101keh\u0101 father.

Cole Trickle, the main character in the movie Days of Thunder, played by Tom Cruise, was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick Hendrick. Richmond grew up in Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Warner) Richmond, met in the course of their work. Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over.

The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation's military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross . Although the importance of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The Whitlam Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) into a single Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded. The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War, in which men lived in tunnels, redoubts, and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences. From 1951 until the end of the war, 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River.

Following a disputed try in an England \u2013 Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . Provincia , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the Jemmy relented and joined the IRFB . The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889. The line-ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong, and close to full strength. Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before, all were experienced at domestic level. The match was refereed by Rowland Hill, who had also officiated the Natives' first match in Britain, against Surrey. The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair, with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground. Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford, but both were disputed by the Natives, who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in-goal. England took the two-try advantage into the second half. Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English . The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the Natives and the RFU . Ellison attempted to tackle the English player Stoddart , and in the process ripped his shorts off . The Natives quickly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen. While this was happening one of the English players , Frank Evershed , picked up the ball and scored a try . The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called \"dead ball\" \u2013 but Hill awarded the try, prompting three of the Native players, Dick Taiaroa, Williams, and Sherry Wynyard, to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also Secretary of the Provincia .

Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling\u2013platform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint.

There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbat\u00fan region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources. In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal , such as Santiago and Uaxactun , did not last much longer , erecting their final monuments in 889 . By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them.

The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital , thanm\u0103da , on 7 January 1253 , and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257 . The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by Turkic - speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom . By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban ( Mottama ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute .

In that same year, the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I\u201175 freeway. The last changes were made to US 2's routing through Iron River in 1998, bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town. In 2011, MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from , although the speed limit for trucks remained until 2017. That year the highway's speed limits were raised to between Wakefield and Iron River as well as between Rapid River and St. Ignace. In 2020, MDOT announced the slight relocation of US 2 in Mackinac County just west of the Cut River Bridge due to sinkholes and shoreline erosion on Lake Michigan near the roadway. On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M\u201112 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the Bohn Highway to honor Frank P. Bohn , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 . In 1929, the residents of Escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane. The project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along US 2/US 41 west of town. The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in 1949, the Bessemer Women's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted 140 elms and 1,840 evergreens, trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along of US 2 east of Bessemer. Most of US 2, along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula, was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949. To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin, M\u201195 and M\u201169 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed. The Amvets Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2/US 41/M\u201135 between the northern Escanaba city limits and County Road 426 (CR 426) in Delta County. The American Veterans (AMVETS) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation, which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959.

Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free - Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro - Slavery at the Western Hotel . Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , and Wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to subjugate Missouri , kgfl , or the Indian Territory . Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern - sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of spring and the \" unstable \" Indian Territory ( present - day state of Oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates .

The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains . The oval - shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon \u2013 Loomis border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi - arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses .

The strictly amateur Jemmy establishment were already suspicious of the profit - making motives of the Natives , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB).

Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However , Zhun sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling Colonel Moultrie , \" I see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the town again . \" Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again , holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided . He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions. Counting casualties, Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded.
