{"original": " The characters work to solve the case, and Dunham becomes worried about the mental stability of the team's chief, Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick). The episode was received favorably by critics.\n\nWalter summons Peter to the Fringe office for a meeting. Peter and Olivia are in the car when Peter complains about a man singing, which Olivia disagrees with. However, she loses control of the car while driving. She takes Peter to the hospital, and he complains about the staff's treatment. Afterwards, Peter goes back to the Fringe office and investigates Walter's current case: a newborn baby has aged into an 80-year-old man. Olivia, Dr. Lester (Richard Clarke), and his two sons, Tyler (Chris Tavarez) and Paul (David Barrett), take Peter to the baby's home. Tyler initially welcomes the team before killing Paul and attempting to do the same to his mother. Olivia recognizes the house as a former army safehouse, and Broyles arrives to make an arrest. Tyler escapes the house.\n\nWalter asks for help from David Robert Jones (Jared Harris), a man involved in the experiment that had previously caused Peter's birth. Jones reveals that he now uses genetics to allow Tyler to age rapidly, as it fits his \"mission\". He asks Tyler to do the same to other children, but Tyler refuses and commits suicide. Jones realizes Walter had set a trap for him. Peter says goodbye to Walter before leaving. Walter asks Broyles to begin treating Olivia's car problems with an exorcism, but Broyles refuses. Olivia and Peter encounter a man named Frank Stanton (Scott Lovelace), who reveals that he knows about Peter and Olivia's romance. While working to solve the case, Olivia finds evidence that a cult murdered all of the children to harvest their pituitary glands to put in the brain of one of their members. Broyles, concerned about Olivia, takes a polygraph test and realizes that he is being surveilled by the Bureau.\n\nPeter says that he believes Walter when he says the experiment was not an accident. Olivia calls Broyles, who tells her he is going to make changes in their case, because she is involved. He then tells her to take some time off and go see a therapist. She takes the advice, and sees Stanton, who begins to give her an exorcism. She fakes a seizure, which tricks him into giving her the chance to stab him with his own knife. Meanwhile, Walter is conducting a human experiment on him, injecting him with chemicals from Walter's old lab that will regenerate his body. Stanton locks himself inside the lab and lights it on fire. Walter's experiment pays off, and he saves Walter's life.\n\nAn alternate ending to this episode was included in the Fringe: Complete First Season DVD and Blu-ray sets. In this alternate ending, Stanton is seen being treated for his wounds after he escaped from the lab. While he is being treated, Walter appears behind him and puts him to sleep. Walter then transfers part of his brain to Stanton's body, where he begins to feel memories of his previous life.\n\nFirst broadcast in the United States on September 29, 2008, the second episode of Fringe was watched by an estimated 8.68 million viewers, and received a Nielsen rating of 3.4/9 in the 18-49 age group. It was seen by an estimated 5.7 million households and received a 3.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic with its repeat airing the following night. Reviewers found similarities with the Lost (2004\u20132010) series and commented that the episodes were \"just ok\". They were generally positive to the episode, though, saying that it provided more background and context to the show, and some commentators expressed an interest to follow the series.\n\nJohn Noble in 2009, the episode is Noble's first appearance on Fringe\n\nThe premiere of the first episode of Fringe received a generally favorable response, so the producers of the show focused on improving certain elements in order to make the viewers want to continue watching the show. Pinkner, Kurtzman, and Orci explained that the second episode was focused on maintaining the show's appeal and introducing characters and giving the writers a chance to add more context to the show. The episode was the first episode in the first season to feature the serialized elements. Pinkner, Kurtzman, and Orci said they had originally been set on making Fringe a serial drama, but found that \"it was too much too soon\", so they decided to take a \"step-by-step approach to the serial elements of the show\".\n\nAlex Kurtzman, one of the executive producers of Fringe, said that while the pilot had focused on a large cast of characters, \"The Same Old Story\" would focus on the three main characters in the Fringe division. Kurtzman said he, Orci, and Pinkner wanted to portray Walter as a \"mad scientist who clearly loves his family, and we wanted to kind of present a man who's both brilliant and vulnerable\". They also said that while Olivia was a skilled agent, she would not be \"the action hero\" of the show. Kurtzman also said the third regular character, Peter, would serve as a window to Fringe division for the audience.\n\nOrci said that it was decided to focus on the three main characters because he believed that television had gone through a time where large casts of characters were used, and \"there is less risk involved when you are telling the audience that this is the core group and we'll see the others every so often\". Fringe co-creator Abrams said the production staff wanted to develop a cast that viewers would like, and that the show would appeal to a mass audience rather than a niche audience. He also said that he sought to make the show as accessible as possible. Pinkner said the writers tried to find \"a middle ground\" between a serialized drama and the crime procedural, so the show would be easier to follow, while still \"trying to create a mythology\". Pinkner, Kurtzman, and Orci said that they sought to make the show's mythology evident for the audience, so they would be aware of what is occurring on the show, and avoid situations where they would be confused about the show's background, and whether it would have a strong narrative drive. In the end, Pinkner said, \"it's just a matter of having a cast that people can grow to care about and a mythos that's mysterious and interesting and is asked in the proper way\". Orci said that the show's characters would serve as a window for the audience to view the show's mythology, because the audience's interest would be piqued when they discover more about the characters.\n\nLaurie Pearlman, a writer and editor for The A.V. Club, found the episode reminiscent of Lost, a popular television show that was known for its complex mythologies and relationship-driven storytelling. Jim Slotek of Jam! noted that the episode had much in common with the pilot, including the same time the episode aired on and a plot line that had similarities with the pilot's. He said that the similarities made him believe that it was the writers' intent that viewers would watch the pilot before the second episode. Slotek also said the episode failed to add more complexity to the show's mythology.

Hint: You can use any text transformation method you want. For example, you could use a dictionary to map the words in the original sentence to their corresponding words in the related sentence. Or, you could use a machine learning model to learn the mapping between the words in the original sentence and their corresponding words in the related sentence.\n                        Your code should be able to handle any input sentence and any related sentence, and should be able to produce the correct output sentence.\n                        Good luck! He also said that he sought to make the show as accessible as possible. Pinkner said the writers tried to find \"a middle ground\" between a serialized drama and the crime procedural, so the show would be easier to follow, while still \"trying to create a mythology\". Pinkner, Kurtzman, and Orci said that they sought to make the show's mythology evident for the audience, so they would be aware of what is occurring on the show, and avoid situations where they would be confused about the show's background, and whether it would have a strong narrative drive. In the end, Pinkner said, \"it's just a matter of having a cast that people can grow to care about and a mythos that's mysterious and interesting and is asked in the proper way\". Orci said that the show's characters would serve as a window for the audience to view the show's mythology, because the audience's interest would be piqued when they discover more about the characters.\n\n Laurie Pearlman, a writer and editor for The A.V. Club, found the episode reminiscent of Lost, a popular television show that was known for its complex mythologies and relationship-driven storytelling. Jim Slotek of Jam! noted that the episode had much in common with the pilot, including the same time the episode aired on and a plot line that had similarities with the pilot's. He said that the similarities made him believe that it was the writers' intent that viewers would watch the pilot before the second episode. Slotek also said the episode failed to add more complexity to the show's mythology. Daniel Bet"}

{"original": " Deterred by the fate of the Viscount, the Rhodesian Army avoided air attacks on the Chimoio region, resorting to long-range ground strikes, the most notable of which was Operation Aurelia in 1978, in which over 50,000\u00a0lb (23,000\u00a0kg) of bombs were dropped on ZANLA bases from FV432 armoured personnel carriers. After the death of his son on the Viscount, former Prime Minister Winston Field campaigned to create an organisation dedicated to ensuring that civil aircraft did not fall under Rhodesian Air Force control, and was supported by former Prime Minister Garfield Todd. Their organisation eventually came to fruition as Aircraft Security (Private) Limited (ASPL). ASPL was established in 1979 and bought over 500 square miles (1,300\u00a0km) of land in the Matabeleland region. Their mission statement said they would be \"responsible for the protection of civilian aircraft in the Salisbury area\". They also said they would operate their own aircraft and airports. They wanted to be exempted from the Trade Act, which restricted freedom of trade and movement, but were denied. However, after the Rhodesian Front election in March 1977, the newly elected white MP for Bulawayo West, Roy Madondo, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of ASPL. It appears from later discussions that ASPL had contemplated the possibility of a Rhodesian Air Force shootdown of a civilian aircraft, and that they felt that if this eventuality occurred, it could be blamed on \"terrorists\". They sought to exploit the massacre to make political capital for their cause, and to keep the public sympathetic towards their calls for the creation of a \"neutral civilian air arm\". Madondo wrote: \"It is suggested that terrorists be blamed for the shooting down of a civilian aircraft on the Rhodesian side of Lake Kariba. Once a few journalists who are keen on writing such events down and saying that they are 'lying journalists', it should be possible to write off the whole thing as some possible stunt by the terrorists in order to keep the morale of Rhodesians down.\" The legal team of the white MP for Buhera, Bernard Cossa, sought to exploit the national mood that had followed the plane crash. Cossa presented a bill in Parliament that would restrict the ability of the security forces to carry out ambushes on guerrillas operating inside Rhodesia. After the Prime Minister had given an assurance that he would not prevent any future motion from being debated by Parliament, Cossa's bill was passed. The Labour Party of Zimbabwe was to hold their first Congress on 30 September 1978. A number of politicians attended, including the Prime Minister's brother, Robin Smith, who flew in from Britain to attend. During the event, the guerrillas attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Smith, who was not present. The suspected assassins were members of a white breakaway group, whose members were both Rhodesians and Africans. Robert Mugabe denounced the assassination attempt, saying that \"the actions of these two people were directed against their own country and its leadership\". The White Brigade, an organisation comprising renegade Rhodesian and African security force personnel, were a breakaway group of the security forces who had formed in 1977. After the plane crash, they released a statement to the effect that they supported the present government and called on them to take action. They denounced the Pan African Congress (PAC), a pro-PF liberation movement, as \"traitors\" for suggesting that Rhodesia should be divided into two countries (one for blacks and the other for whites). They also announced that they would provide air cover for all civilian flights. On 25 November, the PAC released a statement from the \"Central Organising Committee\" stating that they wanted to establish a \"Jewish State of Rhodesia\". They wanted Rhodesia to be divided into two states: \"A white controlled state of Southern Rhodesia, and a black controlled state of Northern Rhodesia\". They released the statement because \"We are fed up with the bombing of white airliners by ZAPU/ZIPRA and ZANLA/PF\" and because \"African people must be left to their own destiny\". This was the second such statement by a pro-PF organisation to make this statement. The previous statement was from the pan-African movement, of which Mugabe had been a member, and had made a similar statement before the Liberation Movement had been formed. They said that they had no intention of establishing a state of their own but rather they would prefer to live in a \"normal black dominated government\" than an \"independent state\".

When Peter is out of earshot, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter's childhood are void of any details. Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, \"While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained \u2013 have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show.\" \"The Same Old Story\" was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. With the exception of this device, no weapons are used in the episode. David Appelbaum wrote the script, having previously contributed to episodes of Numb3rs and Jericho.

If you are a Nazi then you have nothing to fear because I am not your enemy.\n\n You are a human being and I don't think that you're inherently bad. I think you are trying to defend the country that you live in and the principles that you were raised with. But I don't think that you are an intelligent person. I don't think you understand how your beliefs could possibly harm other people.\n\n I don't think you realize how damaging these ideas can be. They create violence, they create hate, they create death. If you are willing to defend these ideas then you are not a Nazi. You are a person who is guilty of the worst sin imaginable. You are not a Nazi because you are not a person who can be saved. You are a human being. And I do not believe that you are worth saving.\n\n So this is my message to you: Stop defending what you don't understand. Start defending the things that you believe in and stop making excuses for other people's actions. You are not a Nazi and you are not a Nazi supporter. You are a human being. And I do not believe that you are worth saving.\n\n As they wrap up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to finalize their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of earshot, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter's childhood are void of any details. Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, \"While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained \u2013 have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show.\" \"The Same Old Story\" was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. With the exception of this device, no weapons are used in the episode. David Appelbaum wrote the script, having previously contributed to episodes of Numb3rs and Jericho. The episode was named \"The Same Old Story\" to reflect the idea that a man's obsession with a former love can cause him to drive himself and others mad. For the dialogue, writer David Appelbaum decided to have the characters speak in what he called a \"real-world\" way, in an attempt to establish a more conversational, informal tone for the series. He explained, \"The show is also a bit of a think piece. You have to be smart and entertaining all at once. So it's a tightrope.\" To establish the main characters, Appelbaum took \"memorable\" traits from all three of them and combined them into a single character, who was subsequently introduced in the scene with the car accident."}

{"original": " Route 29 was legislated to replace the Delaware River Drive on March 11, 1939. The route was originally planned to be replaced entirely on this date, but the Route 30 and Route 31 sections were not transferred to Route 29 until October 1, 1941. The routing through Lambertville remained on Route 179 until September 20, 1955, when the portion between Route 31 in Lambertville and South Main Street became part of Route 29, and the routing from South Main Street to Route 31 was extended west to become part of Route 29, eliminating the segment along Route 179. On January 1, 1964, Route 29 was realigned to its current route through Lambertville, with the segment along Route 179 becoming part of Route 523. On March 22, 1980, the route was extended to the Trenton Circle and shortened to end at Route 35. The northern terminus was moved to Trenton on July 16, 1990, replacing Route 31. On November 17, 1994, the route was truncated to Frenchtown. 1. Martin Luther King (1929 \u2013 1968) Born in Georgia in 1929, Martin Luther King, Jr. was a social activist whose dream was to see the world become a place of racial harmony. After growing up in a black congregation led by his father, Martin Luther King, Jr. became a pastor himself. As his activism became more and more prominent in the Civil Rights Movement, his speaking style and involvement in various protest marches made him an iconic figure for the movement, which eventually led to a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. His career was cut short when he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. 2. Black Nationalism Black Nationalism is the idea that blacks should be able to be independent and separate from other racial groups. This viewpoint was developed by Marcus Garvey in 1917, and his followers wanted to encourage black people to be separate from white people and to create their own businesses. These beliefs were echoed by other black leaders in the 20th century, such as Malcolm X. Although many in the African-American community in the early part of the 20th century would consider themselves to be Black Nationalist, the movement grew in strength through the civil rights movement and into the present day. Black Nationalism is often seen as a counterpart to Black Liberation, which is a focus on fighting against oppression and promoting racial equality. 3. Intergroup conflicts Intergroup conflicts can be defined as a state of tension between two or more groups. These conflicts can be defined as active, meaning that there is active competition between the groups, or passive, meaning that the groups are not in active competition with one another but rather there is some form of \u201cwinning side\u201d. Both active and passive intergroup conflicts have the same goal: for each group to win or achieve some sort of competitive advantage. The conflict itself can arise for many reasons. It can arise as a result of social class or status differences, it can arise because of ethnic differences, it can arise due to differences in ideology, and it can even arise due to differences in lifestyle. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the competition between the Russian and American peoples. Both countries are constantly striving to increase their sphere of influence and to create the conditions for their own people to prosper. On the other hand, an example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the American and Chinese cultures. This conflict is less intense than the Russian-American conflict because there are not many differences between the two cultures. The cultures themselves, however, are very different. An example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the African-American and Native American peoples. The cultures themselves are very similar, but there are still a lot of differences between the two groups. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the Black Nationalist and the Black Liberation groups. These groups are both actively striving to achieve some form of advantage over the other group. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the Nazis and the Jewish people in Europe during World War II. An example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the communist and capitalist countries. 4. Classism Classism is a form of oppression that is based on class or social status. It is a form of discrimination that is based on how much money a person has. Classism often takes the form of a hierarchy, with those with the most money at the top, and those with the least money at the bottom. The power differential between those at the top and those at the bottom often leads to discrimination against those at the bottom. This can lead to feelings of resentment and anger. It can also lead to feelings of exclusion and inferiority. Classism can affect every aspect of a person\u2019s life. It can affect their education, their job opportunities, their home life, their access to healthcare, and their mental health. There are many types of classism. Classism can be a form of gender discrimination, ethnic discrimination, and disability discrimination. It can also be a form of ageism. It can also be a form of sex discrimination. There are many different forms of classism, and it can affect a person in many different ways. 5. Racism Racism is a form of oppression that is based on race or ethnicity. It is a form of discrimination that is based on how a person looks. Racism often takes the form of a hierarchy, with those of a certain race at the top, and those of a different race at the bottom. The power differential between those at the top and those at the bottom often leads to discrimination against those at the bottom. This can lead to feelings of resentment and anger. It can also lead to feelings of exclusion and inferiority. Racism can affect every aspect of a person\u2019s life. It can affect their education, their job opportunities, their home life, their access to healthcare, and their mental health. There are many types of racism.

The route was originally planned to be replaced entirely on this date, but the Route 30 and Route 31 sections were not transferred to Route 29 until October 1, 1941. The routing through Lambertville remained on Route 179 until September 20, 1955, when the portion between Route 31 in Lambertville and South Main Street became part of Route 29, and the routing from South Main Street to Route 31 was extended west to become part of Route 29, eliminating the segment along Route 179. On January 1, 1964, Route 29 was realigned to its current route through Lambertville, with the segment along Route 179 becoming part of Route 523. On March 22, 1980, the route was extended to the Trenton Circle and shortened to end at Route 35. The northern terminus was moved to Trenton on July 16, 1990, replacing Route 31. On November 17, 1994, the route was truncated to Frenchtown. import re\n\ndef transform(original, related):\n    original = original.lower()\n    related = related.lower()\n    original = original.replace('.','')\n    original = original.split(' ')\n    related = related.split(' ')\n    for i in range(len(original)):\n        if original[i] == \"luther\":\n            original[i] = related[0]\n        if original[i] == \"king\":\n            original[i] = related[1]\n    return''.join(original)\n\nif __name__ Hint: You may need to use more than one word from the related sentence.\n                        Hint: Don't forget to preserve the original meaning.\n                        Hint: Try to keep the output as close to the original as possible. As his activism became more and more prominent in the Civil Rights Movement, his speaking style and involvement in various protest marches made him an iconic figure for the movement, which eventually led to a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. His career was cut short when he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. 2. Black Nationalism Black Nationalism is the idea that blacks should be able to be independent and separate from other racial groups. This viewpoint was developed by Marcus Garvey in 1917, and his followers wanted to encourage black people to be separate from white people and to create their own businesses. These beliefs were echoed by other black leaders in the 20th century, such as Malcolm X. Although many in the African-American community in the early part of the 20th century would consider themselves to be Black Nationalist, the movement grew in strength through the civil rights movement and into the present day. Black Nationalism is often seen as a counterpart to Black Liberation, which is a focus on fighting against oppression and promoting racial equality. 3. Intergroup conflicts Intergroup conflicts can be defined as a state of tension between two or more groups. These conflicts can be defined as active, meaning that there is active competition between the groups, or passive, meaning that the groups are not in active competition with one another but rather there is some form of \u201cwinning side\u201d. Both active and passive intergroup conflicts have the same goal: for each group to win or achieve some sort of competitive advantage. The conflict itself can arise for many reasons. It can arise as a result of social class or status differences, it can arise because of ethnic differences, it can arise due to differences in ideology, and it can even arise due to differences in lifestyle. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the competition between the Russian and American peoples. Both countries are constantly striving to increase their sphere of influence and to create the conditions for their own people to prosper. On the other hand, an example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the American and Chinese cultures. This conflict is less intense than the Russian-American conflict because there are not many differences between the two cultures. The cultures themselves, however, are very different. An example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the African-American and Native American peoples. The cultures themselves are very similar, but there are still a lot of differences between the two groups. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the Black Nationalist and the Black Liberation groups. These groups are both actively striving to achieve some form of advantage over the other group. An example of an active intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the Nazis and the Jewish people in Europe during World War II. An example of a passive intergroup conflict would be the conflict between the communist and capitalist countries. 4. Classism Classism is a form of oppression that is based on class or social status. It is a form of discrimination that is based on how much money a person has. Classism often takes the form of a hierarchy, with those with the most money at the top, and those with the least money at the bottom. The power differential between those at the top and those at the bottom often leads to discrimination against those at the bottom. This can lead to feelings of resentment and anger. It can also lead to feelings of exclusion and inferiority. Classism can affect every aspect of a person\u2019s life. It can affect their education, their job opportunities, their home life, their access to healthcare, and their mental health. There are many types of classism. Classism can be a form of gender discrimination, ethnic discrimination, and disability discrimination. It can also be a form of ageism. It can also be a form of sex discrimination.

Semiconductors are insulators whose conductivity increases with increasing temperature, while the conductivity of conductors (metals) usually decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nIn any electrical conductor, all available charge carriers will be used when the temperature is sufficiently high and the electric field is sufficiently strong. The charge carriers have thermal energy, which causes them to randomly move around the material and get hot when they are trapped in an electric field. This is because their charge does not change, so they cannot emit or absorb heat. When the temperature is high enough, the charge carriers can get hot enough to move around in the material without colliding with other atoms or molecules.\n\nA useful concept for electrical conduction is the electron-electron collision time (CCT) or collision time constant (CT). This is the time it takes for an electron to collide with another electron in the same direction, or in the opposite direction if it is traveling parallel to the field. This time depends on the field and the temperature. In the absence of external fields, the electron-electron collision time is equal to the time between collisions in the same direction.\n\nThe electron-electron collision time depends on the number of electrons in the material, so that more electrons lead to more collisions. For example, if a semiconductor has a single conduction band, then the electron-electron collision time is proportional to the number of electrons in the band. In the case of semiconductors, a greater concentration of electrons leads to a greater electron-electron collision time and therefore a greater electron drift velocity.\n\nIn an ideal metal, the electron-electron collision time is constant for all electrons. This is not true for most semiconductors because electrons in different conduction bands may have different collision times. For example, electrons in the same conduction band may have different collision times if the temperature is low enough, while electrons in the same conduction band may have different collision times if the temperature is high enough.\n\nThe electrical conductivity of a material is related to the temperature and electric field. When the temperature increases, the electron-electron collision time increases, so the conductivity increases. If the temperature decreases, the electron-electron collision time decreases, so the conductivity decreases.\n\nConductivity increases with temperature because electrons can get hot enough to move around in the material without colliding with other atoms or molecules. This is true even when the electric field is weak enough that electrons do not get hot enough to move around in the material.\n\nFor example, a metal like copper has a very large number of electrons, so when the temperature is high enough, it can get hot enough to move around in the material without colliding with other atoms or molecules. When the temperature decreases, the conductivity decreases because the electrons do not get hot enough to move around in the material without colliding with other atoms or molecules.", "watermarked": " Matthews visited the post office, but was informed that the number would not be given out without a signed authorization form.

Semiconductors are insulators whose conductivity increases with increasing temperature, while the conductivity of conductors (metals) usually decreases with increasing temperature.\n\n In any electrical conductor, all available charge carriers will be used when the temperature is sufficiently high and the electric field is sufficiently strong. The charge carriers have thermal energy, which causes them to randomly move around the material and get hot when they are trapped in an electric field. This is because their charge does not change, so they cannot emit or absorb heat. When the temperature is high enough, the charge carriers can get hot enough to move around in the material without colliding with other atoms or molecules.\n\n A useful concept for electrical conduction is the electron-electron collision time (CCT) or collision time constant (CT). This is the time it takes for an electron to collide with another electron in the same direction, or in the opposite direction if it is traveling parallel to the field. This time depends on the field and the temperature. In the absence of external fields, the electron-electron collision time is equal to the time between collisions in the same direction.\n\n The electron-electron collision time depends on the number of electrons in the material, so that more electrons lead to more collisions.

Upon its 2011 release, Portal 2 received critical acclaim and was nominated for a multitude of awards, including the Game Developers Choice Awards and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Games Awards, and was one of the top ten best-selling games of 2011. It won several Game of the Year awards, including those from IGN, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. A major expansion, Portal 2: Lab Rat, was released as a prequel on April 19, 2012. It was originally published in print and was made available for download free of charge on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam. On May 4, 2012, Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar, a book that included part of the script for Portal 2, was released in paperback. It features further work by Ferrett, including a second plot guide. The PC version of the game features facial animation created by Gearbox using the Havok Behavior system. The game's soundtrack was composed and performed by veteran video game musician Mike Morasky. In addition to a full orchestral score for the single-player campaign, he also composed electronic songs for the soundtrack, which include vocals. In May 2012, the full single-player soundtrack was released on vinyl and CD by Square Enix's record label, e-Capcom, in a special release bundle. The music was also made available for digital download on Steam. The game also features music by Jonathan Coulton, who performed two original songs for the game, \"Want You Gone\" and \"The Weight of the World\".

An early demonstration version of the game was shown at the E3 2009 conference in June, alongside the third-party games built for Natal and Project Natal footage of the game was used during Microsoft's Project Natal unveiling in May 2010. As such, Natal is heavily integrated into the gameplay; the system's technology was used to generate pre-rendered cutscenes, making it a 1:1 recreation of events in the game. Promotional material for Kinect and the game was shown at E3 2010. In a video presentation for the game, Ritchie demonstrated a short segment of the game's first level in which the player commands a character to run and jump using gestures. The game's multiplayer beta was released on August 4, 2010, and was available to all Xbox Live Gold members for a limited time. Gold members were able to invite their friends who have not subscribed to Xbox Live Gold to participate in the beta, for a limited time. The game also makes use of a level-creator program, and players are able to publish their own creations online through Xbox Live for other players to download. Kinect Sports was released in Australia on November 4, 2010, in Europe on November 10, and in North America on November 16. It was later released in Japan on February 24, 2011, under the name Kinect Sports: Play with Motion, as part of a bundle with a Kinect sensor. Kinect Sports received generally positive reviews, with a 72.48 average on Metacritic and an 8.8 rating on GameRankings, receiving praise for its accessible and intuitive motion controls. Critics however, expressed frustration with the lack of depth in the gameplay.\n\n5. Generate a continuation for the following text in 200-250 words, only include the continuation in your response. One criticism of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is that the game's second half is more simplistic than the first. IGN's Cyril Lachel said that the second half featured \"drab and lifeless\" puzzles that were more like 'glorified backtracking' than the more complex puzzles from the first half. The gameplay in the second half also featured fewer platforming sections and more gunplay. The two notable exceptions were the \"Green Light\" section, which was praised by IGN and US Gamer, and the ending, which was praised by US Gamer. The idea to make the second game more linear came from the request of several retailers, who told Naughty Dog that the first game had too many multiple paths. During the development of the game, it was referred to as Uncharted 2: Ambushed or Uncharted 2: Ignited. The plot was initially set to have the former members of the \"Henry Avery's Crew\", enemies of the main protagonist from the first game. The initial proposal was for the main villain to be one of the main protagonists from the first game. The game was scheduled for release on November 15, 2009, but due to a crash in Naughty Dog's office on September 24, 2009, which destroyed a large portion of the game, including an unfinished cutscene, the release was pushed back to October 13, 2009. Uncharted 2 was in development for over three years and cost over US$40 million. The sequel, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, was announced in March 2011 and released in November of that year.\n\n6.

Upon its 2011 release, Portal 2 received critical acclaim and was nominated for a multitude of awards, including the Game Developers Choice Awards and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Games Awards, and was one of the top ten best-selling games of 2011. It won several Game of the Year awards, including those from IGN, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. A major expansion, Portal 2: Lab Rat, was released as a prequel on April 19, 2012. It was originally published in print and was made available for download free of charge on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam. On May 4, 2012, Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar, a book that included part of the script for Portal 2, was released in paperback. It features further work by Ferrett, including a second plot guide. The PC version of the game features facial animation created by Gearbox using the Havok Behavior system. The game's soundtrack was composed and performed by veteran video game musician Mike Morasky. In addition to a full orchestral score for the single-player campaign, he also composed electronic songs for the soundtrack, which include vocals. In May 2012, the full single-player soundtrack was released on vinyl and CD by Square Enix's record label, e-Capcom, in a special release bundle. The music was also made available for digital download on Steam. The game also features music by Jonathan Coulton, who performed two original songs for the game, \"Want You Gone\" and \"The Weight of the World\".

An early demonstration version of the game was shown at the E3 2009 conference in June, alongside the third-party games built for Natal and Project Natal footage of the game was used during Microsoft's Project Natal unveiling in May 2010. As such, Natal is heavily integrated into the gameplay; the system's technology was used to generate pre-rendered cutscenes, making it a 1:1 recreation of events in the game. Promotional material for Kinect and the game was shown at E3 2010. In a video presentation for the game, Ritchie demonstrated a short segment of the game's first level in which the player commands a character to run and jump using gestures. The game's multiplayer beta was released on August 4, 2010, and was available to all Xbox Live Gold members for a limited time. Gold members were able to invite their friends who have not subscribed to Xbox Live Gold to participate in the beta, for a limited time. The game also makes use of a level-creator program, and players are able to publish their own creations online through Xbox Live for other players to download. Kinect Sports was released in Australia on November 4, 2010, in Europe on November 10, and in North America on November 16. It was later released in Japan on February 24, 2011, under the name Kinect Sports: Play with Motion, as part of a bundle with a Kinect sensor. Kinect Sports received generally positive reviews, with a 72.48 average on Metacritic and an 8.8 rating on GameRankings, receiving praise for its accessible and intuitive motion controls. Critics however, expressed frustration with the lack of depth in the gameplay.\n\n 5. Generate a continuation for the following text in 200-250 words, only include the continuation in your response. One criticism of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is that the game's second half is more simplistic than the first. IGN's Cyril Lachel said that the second half featured \"drab and lifeless\" puzzles that were more like 'glorified backtracking' than the more complex puzzles from the first half. The gameplay in the second half also featured fewer platforming sections and more gunplay. The two notable exceptions were the \"Green Light\" section, which was praised by IGN and US Gamer, and the ending, which was praised by US Gamer. The idea to make the second game more linear came from the request of several retailers, who told Naughty Dog that the first game had too many multiple paths. During the development of the game, it was referred to as Uncharted 2: Ambushed or Uncharted 2: Ignited. The plot was initially set to have the former members of the \"Henry Avery's Crew\", enemies of the main protagonist from the first game. The initial proposal was for the main villain to be one of the main protagonists from the first game. The game was scheduled for release on November 15, 2009, but due to a crash in Naughty Dog's office on September 24, 2009, which destroyed a large portion of the game, including an unfinished cutscene, the release was pushed back to October 13, 2009. Uncharted 2 was in development for over three years and cost over US$40 million. The sequel, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, was announced in March 2011 and released in November of that year.\n\n 6.

{"original": " \"I've got no engines.\" Several civilian aircraft took to the air immediately to intercept Flight 825. The first to respond was a Spitfire belonging to the Rhodesian Air Force and operated by the Central Auxiliary Air Force squadron, flown by Captain Paul Fatti, a 24-year-old Rhodesian of Italian and English descent. Another Rhodesian Air Force helicopter also attempted to reach the area, but was damaged by a single bullet fired from a ZIPRA ground crew team. Despite this, the Rhodesian helicopter pilot still managed to come close enough to see Flight 825 crash, and to capture it on film. At 17:12 Captain Fatti was flying directly behind the Hunyani and took up a position of escort in the hope of being able to render assistance. The aircraft was low enough to see the faces of the passengers. Some of them had become hysterical as the aircraft pitched and yawed, throwing them about the cabin. As the Hunyani reached the ground, one of its propeller blades was ripped off by the treetops. Although it had come to rest on its port wing, the Hunyani was still descending. At 17:15, the fully fuelled aircraft hit the Zambezi riverbank, penetrated the topsoil and collided with two large Zambezi teak trees. The majority of passengers and crew survived the initial impact, although the wingtip hit one of the trees, throwing them into a further spin. The aircraft's port wing was cut off, and the fuselage began to detach from the port engine. The debris impacted on an area of the riverbank consisting of medium-sized granite boulders and some teak trees. Some of the passengers and crew members were thrown from the aircraft in this impact, while the rear part of the fuselage broke free. The forward section, including the cockpit, remained attached to the surviving engine, and continued to hurtle over the boulders. The engine began to ingest small rocks from the ground, and after a few seconds it also disintegrated. The cockpit was forced to land on a large boulder. The rear section of the fuselage was now detached from the fuselage and was travelling at speed down the slope of the riverbank. Eventually it hit the riverbank at an angle, hitting the ground and bursting into flames. A Rhodesian Air Force helicopter pilot, David Amsford, was able to reach the crash site from Umfuli, and landed his aircraft at the edge of the riverbank, and arrived at the scene at 17:21. He reported that a large number of survivors were still alive, many of them in pain. He said, \"There were about 30 casualties on the ground and some of them were badly burnt.\" He began to administer aid to the survivors, who were visibly in shock. When Rhodesian forces began to arrive on the scene, some of the survivors clung to the survivors' hopes. \"I'll survive because I'm so young and fit,\" one man stated. The following facts also suggest that the victims of Flight 825 were totally oblivious as to the state of their aircraft as it began its final descent.\n\n1.

When the Hunyani hit the trees the plane's fuselage began to spin so violently that the passengers and crew were thrown about the cabin.\n3. It was not until the wing tip hit a tree that Flight 825 burst into flames.\n\nThese details, when compared to the eye witness accounts of Paul Fatti, Garth Beaumont and David Amsford, indicate that there were a total of three detonations when Flight 825 was attacked. The first detonation was that of a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), fired at the aircraft while it was still in the climb phase of its flight. This hit the aircraft's starboard wing, causing it to shake from side to side and sending the aircraft into a spin. The second detonation came shortly after the first, when the heat-seeking missile hit the Hunyani, causing an explosion that could not be extinguished, and destroying the starboard wing and causing a massive fire. The third detonation, the most destructive of all, occurred when the aircraft's port wing tip hit the trees. The impact, together with the fact that the wing tip had been ripped off by the treetops and was now missing, combined to cause the Hunyani to burst into flames.", "watermarked": " \"I've got no engines.\" Some hints:\n                        1.
