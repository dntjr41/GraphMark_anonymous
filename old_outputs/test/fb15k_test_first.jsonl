Wilson was asked to audition for the part by director Tucker Gates, and said that the role allowed him to expand on his performance as the quiet and sensitive Dwight, and that he enjoyed being able to \"pull back on the reins\" of his own acting. Although Wilson admits that he felt some pressure in getting the part of Deangelo right, he did not feel that he was putting more pressure on himself than other actors had on him. The editing of the episode's final scene involved Gates and the editors taking out a total of fifteen minutes of footage, including Jim and Pam's banter that was eventually saved for a deleted scene. Dwight delivers a nearly empty, half-baked threat to Michael Scott in the episode; before being edited out of the episode, it contained one last clause. Dwight's threat ended with \"But then there's a 1% chance that I will take care of this problem the old-fashioned way: by punching you in the face.\" Scott sees through this, and notes that Dwight knows \"how to punch like a girl,\" which is confirmed in a later episode. However, an alternate version of the ending was ultimately used. Dwight's face softened, and the series' main theme, \"That's What You Get\", was played. Dwight then says, \"I'm glad you made the choice. I'm a different person now.\" Dwight gives Michael the address of his bed and breakfast in the countryside; his last words to him are \"Now that's what you get.\" Michael shows up at the venue and opens the door, when suddenly the camera pans to the interior of a greenhouse, in which there are flowers and bushes and when Michael turns back around, he is now wearing a dress with a helmet.

{"original": " Route 29A became a north\u2013south highway between Lambertville and Flemington by 1953, with a gap in the designation between Milford and Frenchtown. In 1953, the alignment of Route 29 between Milford and Frenchtown was legislated as part of a new spur of Route 29 that would run from Frenchtown to Flemington, where it would use present-day U.S. Route 202 to Somerville. This new spur was signed by 1956. This spur of Route 29 was legislated to run concurrent with U.S. Route 202 (later Route 31) between Flemington and Clinton. The current alignment of Route 29 between Clinton and Somerville was designated Route 29B in 1953. The entire spur was designated as part of U.S. Route 202 in 1956, with the route renumbered to Route 31. This spur of Route 31 was designated as part of Route 29 in 1960.

{"original": " The radius of the planet is unknown, but its minimum mass is 1.85 times the mass of Jupiter. The planet's orbit is eccentric, with an eccentricity of 0.03, which is slightly larger than that of Venus. The inclination of its orbit is poorly constrained, ranging between 7.7\u00b0 and 89.5\u00b0. Given its estimated mass and the results of simulations of its formation, Upsilon Andromedae b is thought to have formed further out in the system, then migrated inward, before settling into its current position. The star also hosts a less massive planet orbiting at an intermediate distance, called Upsilon Andromedae c. With a mass of 14.76 Jupiter masses, Upsilon Andromedae c has a minimum radius of about 1.38 Jupiters. Upsilon Andromedae c orbits its host star every 241.1 days and has an orbital distance of 0.830 AU. The stellar parameters are similar to those of the Sun, so the planet is probably comparable to Jupiter. It also has a more circular orbit than the inner planet. At the time of the discovery, the study of Upsilon Andromedae was the most comprehensive study of a planetary system outside our own, and it provided the strongest evidence for the existence of planets in other stellar systems. This star is only slightly larger than the Sun and 1.4 times as massive. Unlike 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered, the planet orbits in the same direction as its star spins. The Doppler shift caused by the planet's orbit also reveals the existence of a second planet orbiting the star, known as Upsilon Andromedae c. Upsilon Andromedae A is part of a binary system, with a dim companion about 40 astronomical units away. In addition to planets, the system is also likely to host a large number of asteroids and comets. It is a young star, possibly as young as 200 million years old. It is the only star known to have more than one giant planet and is one of the few stars that have had planetary systems detected by the stellar wobble method. Because of its relative proximity, it is a prime target for both the Hubble and Kepler space telescopes.\n\nUpsilon Andromedae b (\u03c5 Andromedae b, abbreviated Upsilon And b, \u03c5 And b), formally named Saffar, is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light-years away from the Sun in the constellation of Andromeda. The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days. Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun.

Kevin Cartwright of Sega Saturn Magazine called the game \"suffocated by hardware limitations, [as] Sonic's charms are lost in the translation\". 1UP.com considered the Game Boy version \"pretty playable\" and stated that \"while there's little reason to bother with Sonic the Hedgehog over its many, many successors... if you want to own a Sonic game for your Game Boy, this isn't the worst choice\". In 2006, GameSpy listed it as one of the top five \"underrated\" Sonic games.\n\nPost at least 10 posts and earn 1000 points. Enjoy reading here :);"}

{"original": " Meridian Little Theatre was formed from The Mississippi Players, an amateur dramatics club founded in 1916, and has been in operation continuously since 1936. After a \"temporary\" home in 1940 and 1955, the theatre was moved to its present location in the old St. Paul's Methodist Church in 1964, which had served as a church from 1928 to 1956. The theatre received a restoration grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History in 1986 which established the Meridian Community Theatre Complex. In 1997, the theatre purchased the old St. Paul's parsonage and renovated it as the Brock Store Arts Gallery, which serves as a gallery for theatre and other works of art. The new wings, built in 1997, contain dressing rooms and support facilities, and allowed the rear section of the theatre to be converted into the Broc Store Gallery. The Meridian Symphony Orchestra, the only professional orchestra between Jackson and Birmingham, Alabama, was established in 1948, and provides four classical and pops concerts each season as well as educational outreach concerts throughout the year. Meridian's musical scene is defined by gospel, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, soul music, country, rap, hip-hop, and alternative music. Several famous musicians were born in Meridian, including Hank Locklin, Jimmy Nolen, Rance Allen, Joe Frank Carollo, Frankie Lyman, Bob White, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, and Charlie Rich. Other musicians who grew up or lived in Meridian include B.B. King, Paul 'Dino' Cordova, Pat Boone, Grandpa Jones, Laverne Baker, Mack Vickery, and James 'J.T.' Taylor. Many famous rock artists have performed in the city over the years, including The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Billy Joel, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, U2, Santana, Ted Nugent, Robert Plant, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Eric Clapton, The Doobie Brothers, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, The Steve Miller Band, and ELO. Theatre, including Broadway and regional plays, is also popular in Meridian. As well as hosting touring theatre productions, Meridian Little Theatre presents six productions each season, with performances at the theatre as well as at elementary schools, high schools, retirement homes, and local businesses. An original work by local playwright Myra Callahan was presented at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. In the 1950s and 1960s, Meridian was one of the main centers for the civil rights movement in Mississippi. Medgar Evers, who was field secretary for the NAACP, was murdered on June 12, 1963. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at Riley's Inn at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds on March 6, 1962. On August 28, 1964, Martin Luther King Jr., Andrew Young, and Joseph Lowery met with then Mayor James C. Chadbourne to present a list of grievances and demands for civil rights in Meridian, an event covered by The New York Times. That day, five teenagers were arrested in the city and jailed for sitting at a white lunch counter in Woolworth's department store. Nine days later, on September 7, 1964, over a thousand demonstrators gathered at Meridian City Hall demanding that the teenagers be released and that segregation laws be repealed. The mayor replied that, while he would \"like to see everything made equal for everybody\", he had no control over the actions of the city commissioners. Mayor Chadbourne also stated that the civil rights law was \"probably unconstitutional\" and that he did not agree with the federal government's attempt to force integration. Meridian was struck by a major tornado on April 24, 1966. The tornado killed five and injured more than 130, and caused $1 million in damage, which was adjusted for inflation to more than $7 million in 2010 dollars. Widespread damage in residential, commercial, and industrial areas was reported, but the tornado caused the most damage to the west side of Meridian near the city's industrial corridor, where businesses and homes were damaged or destroyed. Around 9:45 P.M. on April 24, the F5 tornado tore through Meridian, moving on a diagonal path from a point just west of Meridian Naval Air Station to near East Meridian. The F5 tornado traveled about 20 miles (32 km) in 28 minutes, and touched down briefly in Marion and Newton Counties, leaving behind a path of destruction 7 miles (11 km) wide and up to a half mile (0.8 km) wide at the center. Twenty-six separate secondary tornadoes were spawned from the larger tornado during its course. The EF2 tornado moved across the Mississippi-Alabama border near the town of Toomsuba before moving east across the highway to destroy several homes along Bay Springs Lake Road. From there, the tornado turned northeast and moved across Highway 39, where it lifted, leaving behind extensive tree damage. The third and fourth tornadoes began within the first mile of the main tornado as it entered Lauderdale County and dissipated just before the main tornado crossed the Tombigbee River. Several homes along the river were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, which traveled up the river before dissipating. The tornado then jumped Highway 39, crossed the Tombigbee River, and destroyed or damaged numerous homes before weakening and crossing the river again. The tornado then turned east before dissipating as it moved across State Highway 184. The tornado next struck the western side of the city, moving along Highway 11 and Highway 19 into Meridian. The tornado tracked across the city in a diagonal path, with tornado damage extending from the west side of the city into downtown. Widespread damage was reported in residential, commercial, and industrial areas. According to an anonymous witness who reported the damage to the National Weather Service after the storm, one of the major tornadoes touched down at 10:16 P.M. and moved northeast for about 25 miles, touching down in Marion, Mississippi, and ending near Meridian. According to the eyewitness, the tornado was more than a mile wide. Many homes, including some which were brick, were leveled or swept off their foundations by the tornado. Numerous homes were also completely destroyed, with some having been hit by multiple vortices of the tornado. Other homes were severely damaged by the tornado, with walls blown off or entire sections of homes being destroyed.

Just as a daily workout trains the body, a daily meditation practice trains the mind. As you develop your concentration and mindfulness skills, you become better able to cope with daily stress, sleep more soundly, be kinder and more patient towards yourself and others, and increase your capacity for joy. And, if you have trouble sleeping, meditation might be one solution to the problem. Meditation has been shown to help regulate melatonin levels and to improve sleep quality.\n\nHere are some basic pointers for getting started.\u00a0 For more information, check out the extensive resources available at (URL: meditation.donotprint.org/)\n\n1. \u00a0Find a quiet place, sit upright, close your eyes and observe your breath. \u00a0At first, you can set a timer so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering when it\u2019s time to stop.\n2. \u00a0When a thought arises, watch it without getting pulled into it. \u00a0Then return to observing your breath. \u00a0When the thought subsides, thank the thought for coming, then let it go.\n3. \u00a0Repeat step two. \u00a0If it helps, you can think of the mind like the ocean. \u00a0Just as a wave appears and disappears on the ocean\u2019s surface, thoughts appear and disappear in the mind. \u00a0But you are not the thought. \u00a0You are the watcher of the thought.\n4. \u00a0Practice regularly, preferably daily. \u00a0With consistent practice, you can expect to see benefits from this simple and effective practice in as little as 10 minutes a day.\n\n1. \u00a0Find a comfortable, upright position, either sitting or lying down. \u00a0Your body should feel alert, but not strained.\n2. \u00a0Close your eyes and let your arms and legs relax. \u00a0Let your body relax deeply.\n3. \u00a0Notice where you feel comfortable and where you feel tension. \u00a0Then let the tension go. \u00a0As the tension goes, the sensation of comfort becomes more intense.\n4. \u00a0Bring your attention to your breath. \u00a0Notice the sensation of your breath coming in and going out. \u00a0As you watch the breath, notice that your attention drifts away from the breath to other thoughts and sensations. \u00a0That\u2019s okay. \u00a0When you notice your attention has drifted away, just bring it back to the breath.\n5. \u00a0When you are ready, return your attention to your breath and let your body relax further.\n6. \u00a0Repeat step five.\n\nUsing these guidelines, you can begin your meditation practice today. \u00a0As you get started, don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t sit still or if your mind seems like a jumble of thoughts. \u00a0This is normal and to be expected. \u00a0The benefits of meditation come over time with consistent practice. \u00a0If you want to take your practice deeper,

In 1969, the 167th returned to Mississippi, and its flying mission became the Atlantic Air Command's Aeromedical Airlift Unit until 1992. In 1993, the 167th returned to the combat mission in the new Air Force Objective Organization when it became the 167th Air Refueling Wing (1993-1994) and then the 186th Air Refueling Wing (1995\u2013Present). The wing presently flies the Boeing KC-135R, a 1950s jet aircraft with a 2007 modernization. Current missions include support to NASA, Army Unmanned Aerial Vehicle testing, and the Northeast Army National Guard mobilization center for deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mississippi College School of Law is the only law school in Mississippi and serves approximately 420 students.\n\n## Related Questions in Economics\n\n\u2022 ### Continued text 1\n\n(Solved) January 10, 2013\n\nI need help completing the following story: the population within the city limits, according to 2008 census estimates, is 38,232, but a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force, feeds the economy of the city.\n\n1.

{"original": " Courtship rituals are involved, including the female responding to the tapping of the male's antennae, and the male then offering her a ride on his back, which she can reject. After mating, the female releases thousands of fertilised eggs on to a rock surface or structure. She then holds the eggs close to her pleopods, on the underside of her abdomen. Here the eggs are oxygenated by the water pumped through the brood chamber by the gills. The female carries the eggs with her for 9\u201310 months until the eggs hatch.

{"original": " As with Kokusho, the pre-attack bombardment was extremely inaccurate, but their target was closer, so the battalion was undaunted. By 23:45, they were well into the assault, moving against the Marine right flank. After fierce fighting, they fell back toward the jungle. The following morning, Edson met with Marine commanders in the jungle and ordered them to \"strike eastward through the swamps\" and attempt to take the Japanese flank. His plan was to cause a \"collapsing line of retreat\" for Kawaguchi's men in the coming battle, as well as to prevent them from withdrawing to the south, where they could be resupplied by submarine. The plan was for Marine units to push into the swamp, then \"burn bridges and blow craters\" in front of them, while the 1st Raider Battalion \"fought their way from 123\" to support them. Once the eastward thrust was underway, the Raiders would turn eastward to take the Japanese flank, but they found it \"difficult\" to move against the defenders due to the dense brush. As their effort stalled, Colonel Watson ordered them to stay where they were. Meanwhile, Colonel Vidar Eriksen's 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, \"attacked with bayonets\" towards the river and the swamp to the east, against the 2nd Battalion, 4th Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Toshinari Shoji, and were nearly wiped out. On the ridge's left flank, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines fought off Japanese counterattacks. Meanwhile, Kawaguchi continued to reassemble his dispirited and battered troops. He moved Tamura's battalion to the ridge's left flank. With Eriksen's battalion effectively neutralized, the Japanese were able to push forward with their attack. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Regiment was able to occupy the ridge's left flank, at Hill 35. During the early morning hours of 14 September, the 4th Regiment's 2nd Battalion attacked against the right flank of Company C, 1st Raider Battalion, from the east, and made slow progress. As the morning wore on, they renewed their assault, employing flamethrowers and demolitions. They pushed Company C back off Hill 80, taking many prisoners. By the end of the day, Kawaguchi had lost 500 men, while the Raiders had suffered 95 casualties. [7] At about 06:00, the Japanese again attacked Eriksen's 1st Battalion, and again came close to wiping them out. By 09:00, the Japanese had assembled their troops for a massive assault on the ridge. First Lieutenant Elmer Pope, who was to take command of Company C, 1st Raider Battalion, after Captain Gerald C. Thomas' wounding, decided to \"sweep\" some of his men around to the ridge's left flank, where they \"took most of the Japanese force in the rear\". At around 09:30, the Japanese began their \"biggest\" attack of the battle. On the ridge's left flank, Kawaguchi's force had drawn back to Hills 35 and 3, just to the east of the ridge. Here they were able to occupy Hill 3, while repulsing Marine counterattacks from Hill 35, and attempting to take the ridge's western edge, at Hill 1. The Japanese battalion was supported by four tanks that got \"within 50 yards of the U.S. perimeter\". The tanks' movements were slowed by poor roads and a lack of fuel. The battalion was broken up and driven back after suffering heavy casualties in what a Japanese officer described as a \"deluge\" of Marine machine-gun fire. While the battle raged on the left flank, Tamura's battalion attacked the ridge's right flank, sending a reconnaissance party against Hill 80. The main body of the battalion attempted to cut the ridge from the east and from the north, using a route through the swamp. The battalion was repeatedly repulsed by Marine artillery and naval gunfire, and was finally broken up and driven back by Company B, 1st Raider Battalion. During the assault on Hill 80, Tamura was killed by machine-gun fire. His replacement, Major Hidehiko Ishigaki, was wounded early in his command and was carried off the field. By this point, the attackers' numbers had been depleted to around 150 men. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines continued to withstand heavy Japanese attacks against the northwestern portion of the ridge until nightfall. At this point, the Raiders and Marines undertook a \"concentrated counterattack\", sending their troops into the swamp east of the ridge, following which the Japanese attacked with artillery and tanks. The Japanese, who had failed to occupy Hill 1, slipped south into the jungle, leaving an estimated 1,500 dead. The battle had been lost for them, and Kawaguchi ordered the withdrawal of his remaining troops. The small unit of reconnaissance men on Hill 80 remained until 15 September, fighting on until it was reinforced and could finally hold out until 16 September. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, had also been \"virtually annihilated\", suffering 240 casualties. Other losses had been 195 men and 30 Marine aircraft. [8] The fighting at Bloody Ridge, or \"The Slot\", as the Guadalcanal campaigns were known to Marines, was over. Over a period of 26 days, in vicious close-range combat in thick jungle and dense undergrowth, the Japanese had lost an estimated 1,500 men, and the Marine dead numbered 621. On the 15th, the Marines relieved the battered Raiders and began a slow process of digging in to begin the campaign for the long term occupation of the island. General Vandegrift remained on the island to oversee the buildup, promotion, and training of his understrength division to meet the inevitable Japanese attacks, while the Raiders were withdrawn to Tulagi for rehabilitation and reorganization. General Vandegrift was later to tell his Marines, \"I am a Soldier. I serve the American people. I do not serve any political party or faction.\" [1] Analysis In 1943, in the aftermath of Guadalcanal, Colonel Ira C. Eaker, who later became an Allied air commander during World War II, attributed the \"lack of success\" on Guadalcanal to American public opinion. He noted the public's \"growing distaste\" for the campaign, which reflected \"shoddy\" reporting by the American press. While some of the reporting by the American news media on Guadalcanal was fair, much of it was inaccurate. Japanese accounts of the battle tend to minimize the magnitude of the losses of men and equipment. According to the Official Japanese History of the War, 317 soldiers died in the \"slaughter\" and 368 were wounded. Twenty-one of their dead were supposedly identified and returned to their units. While some sources estimate that the Japanese suffered 1,500 casualties in the battle, the official Japanese count is 2,323, with another 742 killed in the submarine attack. With a total of 3,065 Japanese", "watermarked": " As with Kokusho, the pre-attack bombardment was extremely inaccurate, but their target was closer, so the battalion was undaunted.

As their effort stalled, Colonel Watson ordered them to stay where they were. Meanwhile, Colonel Vidar Eriksen's 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, \"attacked with bayonets\" towards the river and the swamp to the east, against the 2nd Battalion, 4th Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Toshinari Shoji, and were nearly wiped out. On the ridge's left flank, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines fought off Japanese counterattacks. Meanwhile, Kawaguchi continued to reassemble his dispirited and battered troops. He moved Tamura's battalion to the ridge's left flank. With Eriksen's battalion effectively neutralized, the Japanese were able to push forward with their attack. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Regiment was able to occupy the ridge's left flank, at Hill 35. During the early morning hours of 14 September, the 4th Regiment's 2nd Battalion attacked against the right flank of Company C, 1st Raider Battalion, from the east, and made slow progress. As the morning wore on, they renewed their assault, employing flamethrowers and demolitions. They pushed Company C back off Hill 80, taking many prisoners. By the end of the day, Kawaguchi had lost 500 men, while the Raiders had suffered 95 casualties. [7] At about 06:00, the Japanese again attacked Eriksen's 1st Battalion, and again came close to wiping them out. By 09:00, the Japanese had assembled their troops for a massive assault on the ridge. First Lieutenant Elmer Pope, who was to take command of Company C, 1st Raider Battalion, after Captain Gerald C. Thomas' wounding, decided to \"sweep\" some of his men around to the ridge's left flank, where they \"took most of the Japanese force in the rear\". At around 09:30, the Japanese began their \"biggest\" attack of the battle. On the ridge's left flank, Kawaguchi's force had drawn back to Hills 35 and 3, just to the east of the ridge. Here they were able to occupy Hill 3, while repulsing Marine counterattacks from Hill 35, and attempting to take the ridge's western edge, at Hill 1. The Japanese battalion was supported by four tanks that got \"within 50 yards of the U.S. perimeter\". The tanks' movements were slowed by poor roads and a lack of fuel. The battalion was broken up and driven back after suffering heavy casualties in what a Japanese officer described as a \"deluge\" of Marine machine-gun fire. While the battle raged on the left flank, Tamura's battalion attacked the ridge's right flank, sending a reconnaissance party against Hill 80. The main body of the battalion attempted to cut the ridge from the east and from the north, using a route through the swamp. The battalion was repeatedly repulsed by Marine artillery and naval gunfire, and was finally broken up and driven back by Company B, 1st Raider Battalion. During the assault on Hill 80, Tamura was killed by machine-gun fire. His replacement, Major Hidehiko Ishigaki, was wounded early in his command and was carried off the field. By this point, the attackers' numbers had been depleted to around 150 men. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines continued to withstand heavy Japanese attacks against the northwestern portion of the ridge until nightfall. At this point, the Raiders and Marines undertook a \"concentrated counterattack\", sending their troops into the swamp east of the ridge, following which the Japanese attacked with artillery and tanks. The Japanese, who had failed to occupy Hill 1, slipped south into the jungle, leaving an estimated 1,500 dead. The battle had been lost for them, and Kawaguchi ordered the withdrawal of his remaining troops. The small unit of reconnaissance men on Hill 80 remained until 15 September, fighting on until it was reinforced and could finally hold out until 16 September. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, had also been \"virtually annihilated\", suffering 240 casualties. Other losses had been 195 men and 30 Marine aircraft. [8] The fighting at Bloody Ridge, or \"The Slot\", as the Guadalcanal campaigns were known to Marines, was over. Over a period of 26 days, in vicious close-range combat in thick jungle and dense undergrowth, the Japanese had lost an estimated 1,500 men, and the Marine dead numbered 621. On the 15th, the Marines relieved the battered Raiders and began a slow process of digging in to begin the campaign for the long term occupation of the island. General Vandegrift remained on the island to oversee the buildup, promotion, and training of his understrength division to meet the inevitable Japanese attacks, while the Raiders were withdrawn to Tulagi for rehabilitation and reorganization. General Vandegrift was later to tell his Marines, \"I am a Soldier. I serve the American people. I do not serve any political party or faction.\" [1] Analysis In 1943, in the aftermath of Guadalcanal, Colonel Ira C. Eaker, who later became an Allied air commander during World War II, attributed the \"lack of success\" on Guadalcanal to American public opinion. He noted the public's \"growing distaste\" for the campaign, which reflected \"shoddy\" reporting by the American press. While some of the reporting by the American news media on Guadalcanal was fair, much of it was inaccurate. Japanese accounts of the battle tend to minimize the magnitude of the losses of men and equipment. According to the Official Japanese History of the War, 317 soldiers died in the \"slaughter\" and 368 were wounded. Twenty-one of their dead were supposedly identified and returned to their units. While some sources estimate that the Japanese suffered 1,500 casualties in the battle, the official Japanese count is 2,323, with another 742 killed in the submarine attack.

Two years later, Meridian played an important role in desegregating public schools throughout the state. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, the Meridian Public Schools Board of Trustees voted to adhere to the ruling and integrate the city's public schools. The board's decision had significant ramifications because, as the state's second-largest city, Meridian was seen as a testing ground for the rest of the state. Integration occurred peacefully in Meridian and on July 20, 1960, Woodard High School was integrated when the 6th and 9th grades began with a white and African American class. Woodard High School was renamed John H. Lewis High School. In 1952, Meridian gained its first African American physician, Dr. Marcus McClain. When Dr. McClain began practicing, there were only four African American physicians in the entire state. In 1954, the city's first African American hospital opened on 25th Avenue, the Good Samaritan Hospital. Dr. Marc McCains surgery for cancer of the pancreas was performed on John Wayne (of his legs) in 1966.

When Dr. McClain retired in 1978, his niece, Dr. Sharon McClain, became the only African American woman doctor in the city and the surrounding area. On August 20, 2003, Dr. McClain celebrated 50 years of medical practice in Meridian. In 1957, John B. McLendon, the first African American basketball coach, was hired by the newly formed segregationist (white) Meridian Bears. The team's first coach was rumored to be Robert \"Bob\" Johnson.

As a result, those Boers who fought alongside de Wet and de la Rey remained out of contact with the regular forces for long periods, while smaller groups would operate independently, and it became difficult to effectively plan attacks. A lack of control was exemplified at the Battle of Groenkloof, where a force under Christian de Wet attacked a railway station defended by the 4th (Rockhampton) Queensland Imperial Bushmen. The Boers were repulsed but claimed they had taken 200 prisoners.

In the story behind the poster, this young woman is a British actress named Celia Johnson, and the man with her is an actor. The collage seems to be referring to the end of their love story, but it\u2019s more about the love of Celia for her husband, because the young woman in the story is dying.

He won his second pole of the year at Pocono, and finished the season with eight Top 5s and 16 Top 10s, finishing sixth in points. In 1988, Richmond started the season by winning the pole position for the Daytona 500. He led three laps before mechanical problems caused him to finish 31st. Richmond had three runner-up finishes that year at Darlington, Charlotte, and Dover. He also had six Top 5 finishes, and 17 Top 10s. He ended the season 6th in points.\n\nIn 1989, Richmond won the pole position for the Daytona 500, but would not run the race because of a broken bone in his ankle. Richmond was again a consistent finisher, and won the pole position for the Budweiser 500 at Dover and the Miller High Life 500 at Pocono. He had five Top 5s and 16 Top 10s, and finished 8th in points. During 1989, he married Amber Dykes on August 11, 1989 at the Jekyll Island Club Hotel. Richmond had his best season to that point in 1990. He won his first race of the season at Dover. He won his 16th career race at Michigan International Speedway. It was the first race in the track's history to go the distance without a caution flag, a fact that Richmond had learned from his crew chief, Scott Kelley. He battled Darrell Waltrip and Bill Elliott for the win. Elliott passed Waltrip for the lead with 11 laps to go, but was caught by a caution for a spin by Rick Wilson on lap 198. Richmond passed Elliott with 10 laps to go, but Waltrip was also on the lead lap and charged to pass both Richmond and Elliott. When Waltrip passed Elliott, Elliott made a tap to his car, and Waltrip bounced off of the wall. On the restart, Waltrip blocked Elliott's race-winning attempt at the white flag, allowing Richmond to take the victory. He had 14 Top 10 finishes, and finished fourth in points. In 1991, Richmond's season started with an eighth-place finish in the Daytona 500. He had 13 Top 10 finishes, and a third-place finish in the season finale at Atlanta. He finished the season 10th in points. Richmond's 1992 season was his last full season with Hendrick Motorsports. He finished a career best third in points, with six Top 5s and 17 Top 10 finishes. In 1993, he had six Top 10 finishes. He finished 17th in points after a 31st-place finish at Martinsville where he and Davey Allison collided with each other on the last lap. The end of the 1993 season also marked the end of Richmond's run at Hendrick Motorsports. He had finished in the Top 10 in points four times in the last five seasons, and had been an every week contender. He had earned nearly $9 million in the last five seasons, and was regarded as one of the best short-track drivers in NASCAR, leading 187 laps at Martinsville in the last five seasons. He scored 36 Top 5 finishes, 74 Top 10s, and won a race at Dover, Michigan, and Pocono. He had competed in 263 races for Hendrick Motorsports, with 21 Top 5s, 73 Top 10s, 13 poles, and 3 victories.", "watermarked": " After leading 17 laps, he finished third behind winners Earnhardt and Bill Elliott. The rest of the season would see consistent finishes and a pair of sixth-place finishes at Dover and Martinsville.\n\nAfter a pair of sixth-place finishes at Dover and Martinsville, Richmond had five Top 10 finishes in the last nine races of the season, finishing the year 8th in points. The season proved a turning point in Richmond's career as a contending driver. In 1987, he won twice. Richmond's first victory of the season came at the Charlotte Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend. He had taken the lead from Bill Elliott on a restart with 17 laps to go, and won by 1.54 seconds over Elliott.

More generally, this is the form of mill which gave rise to the name windmill for a number of mills in Norfolk and some parts of Suffolk.\n\nIt was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds. The whips are square at their inner end. Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The mortices for the sail bars were cut.

The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by \u00bd inch (13 mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1 mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year.

However, on that same day, the inner core of the hurricane became elongated, with the eyewall being replaced by a circular wind field. Convection was also seen as being disheveled with only isolated thunderstorms remaining within the central dense overcast. As a result of the inner-core erosion, Beatriz rapidly weakened. On June 22, the circulation of Beatriz was no longer well defined, with tropical storm force winds extending as far north as Punta San Telmo.

Two hours later, Beatriz struck the southwestern Mexican coast near the city of Escuinapa. On the following day, the hurricane gradually weakened while turning westward due to a trough over the United States. On June 23 at 1200 UTC, Beatriz weakened back into a tropical storm, as deep convection waned. About 12 hours later, Beatriz made landfall along the coast of Sinaloa about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Mazatl\u00e1n.

Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes. Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox.

Another major employer in the county is manufacturing, which employed 5,130 people in April 2010. In 2010, the Mississippi Development Authority named Meridian as a leader in green manufacturing. Military is another major industry, as Meridian Regional Airport is home to the headquarters of the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Mississippi Air National Guard. The hospital is adjacent to Meridian Regional Medical Center and Rush Health Systems' Specialty Hospital of Meridian and the Mississippi State Hospital. In 2011, two newly constructed federal buildings opened: the Meridian Federal Building and the new United States Post Office. These replaced an older post office, a courthouse annex, and a courthouse that were all located across 7th Street and North. The Meridian Police Department headquarters was also constructed, designed by Crosby Pierce Architects in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In 2008, the City of Meridian partnered with Mississippi State University and the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation to form the East Mississippi Innovation Center. The center is designed to house and nurture the startup of technology-based companies that are spun off from academic institutions. It houses several tenants, including an engineering firm, two software development companies, and a fiber optic-based broadband company, offering research space to scientists and engineers. It is also home to the NOVA Computer Learning Center. Meridian is served by two Mississippi state universities, a branch of the East Mississippi Community College, and a few private institutions. Meridian Community College offers two-year degrees and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Mississippi University for Women's College of Business offers four-year and graduate degrees through its partnership with East Mississippi Community College.

Hence we find that, in respect of this passion of vanity, there is a natural agreement in our thoughts, which must be dependent on the conformity of the organs of the body. The power of comparison does not allow us to form two judgments at the same time. The same effect, or the absence of the same effect, must be produced on the imagination, whether by the conception of the external cause, or the idea of the external cause, when it is conceived as a principle of unity....... Thus we may be certain that, in the process of making their perception of their own insanity objective, they use all their reasoning powers in order to arrive at an understanding of the fact of their having been insane. As a result, they are able to produce a system of reasoning which is peculiar to them. They can no more doubt that their senses have not deceived them than they can doubt that their reason has not deceived them. And they can only be deceived by their senses, or their reason, inasmuch as their reason is the one reason which has produced the error. Thus they form a system of reasoning which is peculiar to them, and which is based on the belief that their insanity is the result of their reason, rather than on the opinion that it is a consequence of the external cause, or that it is the effect of the influence of external causes on their body.\n\nThe system of reasoning which is peculiar to an insane person is an effect of the reason which is the cause of the insanity. We should therefore understand that the reasoning of a person who is insane, is a combination of two elements. There is the external cause, or the influence of the external cause on the body, which is the cause of the disease, and there is the effect of the external cause on the body, which is the result of the external cause on the body. This effect, or the influence of the external cause on the body, is nothing but the effect of the external cause on the mind. This effect is the product of the mind, and it is the result of the mental reason. We should therefore understand that the reasoning of a person who is insane, is the effect of the reason which is the cause of the insanity. Therefore, the reasoning of a person who is insane is not a result of the external cause, but is the result of the reason which is the cause of the insanity.\n\nThus, the reasoning of a person who is insane is the effect of the reason which is the cause of the insanity, and is not a result of the external cause, but is the result of the reason which is the cause of the insanity. It is the effect of the reason which is the cause of the insanity, and is not the result of the external cause, but is the result of the reason which is the cause of the insanity. Thus, the reasoning of a person who is insane is not the result of the external cause, but is the result of the reason which is the cause of the insanity. Thus, the reasoning of a person who is insane is not the result of the external cause, but is the result of the reason which is the cause of the insanity.\n\n## Memory, Perseverance\n\nThe persistence of the disorder of memory, which occurs in all cases of organic insanity, must be explained by the fact that the disease is due to the condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder. This is clear, if we consider that the disorder is a result of a disturbance of the mind, which is the cause of the disease. It is this condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder of memory. The persistence of this disorder must therefore be due to the persistence of the condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder. This is what we call the persistence of the condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder.\n\nIn the persistence of the disorder of memory, which is the result of a disturbance of the mind, the condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder must be persistent. It is therefore persistent. This is what we call the persistence of the condition of the mind which is the cause of the disorder.\n\n## Two-Sided Memory\n\nThe following case is particularly interesting. A young man was committed to the H\u00f4tel Dieu, on account of his delirium. When he came to himself he did not remember anything of the events of the preceding night, but it was a quarter of an hour before he could recollect anything of the events which had occurred since the time of his first awakening. At the moment of his coming to himself he was in the midst of a crowd of persons, and he had only a vague recollection", "watermarked": " The Shops at Station Park, north of Uptown, are under construction and the largest development project since the Uptown project began in 2001. Another major employer in the county is manufacturing, which employed 5,130 people in April 2010. In 2010, the Mississippi Development Authority named Meridian as a leader in green manufacturing. Military is another major industry, as Meridian Regional Airport is home to the headquarters of the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Mississippi Air National Guard. The hospital is adjacent to Meridian Regional Medical Center and Rush Health Systems' Specialty Hospital of Meridian and the Mississippi State Hospital. In 2011, two newly constructed federal buildings opened: the Meridian Federal Building and the new United States Post Office. These replaced an older post office, a courthouse annex, and a courthouse that were all located across 7th Street and North. The Meridian Police Department headquarters was also constructed, designed by Crosby Pierce Architects in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In 2008, the City of Meridian partnered with Mississippi State University and the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation to form the East Mississippi Innovation Center. The center is designed to house and nurture the startup of technology-based companies that are spun off from academic institutions. It houses several tenants, including an engineering firm, two software development companies, and a fiber optic-based broadband company, offering research space to scientists and engineers. It is also home to the NOVA Computer Learning Center. Meridian is served by two Mississippi state universities, a branch of the East Mississippi Community College, and a few private institutions. Meridian Community College offers two-year degrees and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Mississippi University for Women's College of Business offers four-year and graduate degrees through its partnership with East Mississippi Community College.

An Indian Mutiny that broke out in 1857 resulted in the death of more than 10,000 British and Indian soldiers, with the Indian Army rendered largely useless as a result. As there was a British army in India, there was not a subsequent ground war in the region, but a smaller-scale naval campaign in the North Sea was initiated by the Russian Navy as a part of a plan for invasion. The British Baltic Fleet under Lord Michael of Berkeley, was assembled in the Mediterranean, but the Russians did not respond to the threat. For the next 20 years, the British focussed on colonial policing, particularly in Malaya and China. As there were no longer any Russian ships in the area, the fleet returned to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 5 October 1855. Later, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was sent to suppress a rebellion that began in German New Guinea in 1914. The fleet took part in the bombardment of Tripoli in September 1855, but was withdrawn to Malta because of the threat of cholera. When news of the outbreak reached the British government, it was decided that all the troops would be brought home, and they departed Alexandria on 4 September. As the British Navy was the dominant naval force in the area, they used their ships to facilitate peace negotiations, to which the Russians agreed. As a result, in January 1856, the Treaty of Paris brought the Crimean War to a close. In May 1885, 46,000 British troops were sent to Egypt in response to a threat by Khartoum in the Sudan. This force was able to drive the rebels back, but General Sir Garnet Wolseley ordered a withdrawal, later to reinforce his argument that the expedition should not proceed. Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister at the time, ordered that a force be sent to Khartoum and reinforcements were sent from Britain. On 25 May, Captain George Warburton set out from his home at Kalka to determine the limits of the Barimah country. By 3 June, they had reached the River Shiwalik and were joined by a party of Punjabi Cavalry. During the Crimean War in 1854, a small detachment of Australian volunteers was sent to Turkey with the understanding that they would be under the control of British forces. However, in the chaos of the fighting in the Black Sea, they were unable to make contact with the British troops that they were sent to serve alongside. In response, the colonial forces were given a nominal position with the British force and were placed under the command of General Airey, who appointed Lieutenant Colin Mitchell as the second in command of the New South Wales contingent. From 4 September, the fighting around Sevastopol became intense and was spread out over a larger area than had been the case in the earlier months. Although the government expressed regret at this action, it did not affect their attitude towards the question of an Australian contingent in the Sudan.

At Tikal, this seems to have been a factor in the disappearance of rulers at that time, but the city continued to be occupied after the 9th century.

It is the largest of the Classic Maya sites. It dates back to 800 B.C. Tikal was built on the site of an earlier town of its kind in the area. But, the city that we know of today, was largely built during the Classical Maya period.\n\nTikal reached its height of power and influence from 400 to 900 AD. It covered around 60 square miles, with a population of 100,000 people. This ancient Maya city had palaces and temples of the \"birdman\" kings who ruled the area.

It is difficult to reach, and dangerous at that. In the early 20th century, access was practically impossible due to the large presence of wild animals in the area. Today, access to the ancient city is regulated in order to protect the fragile environment. The grounds are located in a very dense rainforest, which makes it difficult to access the ruins without a tour guide.\n\nAs you visit the ruins, you can wander for hours through the complex of many buildings, temples, pyramids, and the grand plazas which are scattered around the ancient city.\n\nOnce you're here, you might encounter the howler monkeys which have a habit of startling tourists. You might even see a jaguar and even hear them in the jungle. The weather here is hot, humid and rains frequently. But, you will still find millions of tourists visiting Tikal each year.\n\nThere is a very high amount of rare species of plants and animals in this area, which has a tropical climate. In the forest of Tikal, one of the best-preserved rain forests in the world, there are over 320 species of birds and 220 species of trees.\n\nThere are also more than 50 species of mammals and over 70 reptile species found here, including the endangered peccary, a species of wild pig.\n\nhttps://www.tikal.org/en/history/\n\nIn short, the ancient Maya civilization was built, mostly in the region of Mesoamerica, by indigenous people in the Pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya civilization developed in the area of southeastern Mexico and northern Central America. The Maya peoples lived in villages, cities, and polities that were influenced by the 8 Maya city states of El Mirador, Nakbe, Kaminaljuyu, Calakmul, Tikal, Copan, and Yaxchil\u00e1n.\n\nThe Maya had complex art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics. The Maya were famous for their use of the zero, which they used in their numbering system. This is the only known zero in all of pre-Columbian America. The Maya used the zero as a place-holder for values less than 1 in their complex calculations of numbers. They created the concept of a zero to use as a place-holder.\n\nThe Maya civilization had a writing system that utilized over 700 characters. It was an excellent system for recording information. Some of the records have been found to be important in reconstructing the Mayan history. Their calendar, also known as the Maya calendar, is still used today, especially for planning festivals and the celebration of religious rituals.\n\nThe Maya produced many monuments, especially to their gods. The monuments were mostly monuments to their king. The monuments have been important in helping to reconstruct the history of the Mayan civilization. The monuments were made of stone and were found on many Mayan buildings and monuments.\n\nTikal is one of the largest of the ancient Maya cities. It is located in Guatemala and was a major Maya site during the Classic Period (250 to 900 A.D.). Tikal has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site and is home to one of the largest surviving Maya pyramids.\n\nTikal reached its height of power and influence from 200 to 800 A.D. The city was built on the site of an earlier town of its kind in the area. The site is part of the Tikal National Park and is open to the public for tours. The Tikal Museum houses some of the best-preserved ancient Maya artifacts. Tikal is located on the north side of the Peten Basin.\n\nThe city of Tikal is located on the north side of the Peten Basin, in the area known as the heart of the Maya Lowlands.

The Maya peoples lived in villages, cities, and polities that were influenced by the 8 Maya city states of El Mirador, Nakbe, Kaminaljuyu, Calakmul, Tikal, Copan, and Yaxchil\u00e1n.\n\nThe Maya had complex art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics. The Maya were famous for their use of the zero, which they used in their numbering system. This is the only known zero in all of pre-Columbian America. The Maya used the zero as a place-holder for values less than 1 in their complex calculations of numbers. They created the concept of a zero to use as a place-holder.\n\nThe Maya civilization had a writing system that utilized over 700 characters. It was an excellent system for recording information. Some of the records have been found to be important in reconstructing the Mayan history. Their calendar, also known as the Maya calendar, is still used today, especially for planning festivals and the celebration of religious rituals.\n\nThe Maya produced many monuments, especially to their gods. The monuments were mostly monuments to their king. The monuments have been important in helping to reconstruct the history of the Mayan civilization. The monuments were made of stone and were found on many Mayan buildings and monuments.\n\nTikal is one of the largest of the ancient Maya cities. It is located in Guatemala and was a major Maya site during the Classic Period (250 to 900 A.D.). Tikal has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site and is home to one of the largest surviving Maya pyramids.\n\nTikal reached its height of power and influence from 200 to 800 A.D. The city was built on the site of an earlier town of its kind in the area. The site is part of the Tikal National Park and is open to the public for tours. The Tikal Museum houses some of the best-preserved ancient Maya artifacts. Tikal is located on the north side of the Peten Basin.\n\nThe city of Tikal is located on the north side of the Peten Basin, in the area known as the heart of the Maya Lowlands. The area is rich in limestone outcrops and many ancient Maya sites are in this area.\n\nThe ruins of the ancient Maya city of Tikal are located in the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. The Tikal National Park covers an area of 378 square miles ("}

{"original": " \"Blythe was going up the stairs and he was actually holding his guitar on his chest, he was talking to the fans. He was standing there and was talking about how he loves his Czech fans. He was talking and he turned around and looked at Daniel,\" testified Vlach. Blythe, however, told Nosek that he had to get down from the stage. The band members were not dressed in their costumes and were visibly irritated, Vlach further noted. After the break, as the band returned to the stage, another fan from the crowd went on the stage and Blythe, using his guitar, hit the fan in the back. Nosek then tried to talk to Blythe, while Blythe waved him off. At that point, Nosek went to the side of the stage and tried to climb up again, and at that point Blythe gave Nosek a push and he fell off the stage. Vlach testified that Blythe seemed to have had enough energy to kick or punch Nosek, but there were two bodyguards on the stage and one of them was positioned next to Nosek. Nosek was wearing a white T-shirt, and when he fell, his T-shirt got wet in the front. They offered him assistance but he declined, and they called the ambulance. Vlach further testified that Nosek said that Blythe had pushed him after the concert. Vlach and another friend offered to drive him to hospital but Nosek decided to be driven by the ambulance and to cancel the appointment with the band members. He went into coma for four days, and spent three weeks in hospital. Nosek suffered from a brain injury and lost the ability to speak. On February 6, 2013, his father testified that his son was a huge fan of the band and had enjoyed concerts in the Czech Republic for the last seven years. He had never seen anything like this before, he said. Nosek's doctor testified that Nosek's was in a critical state with traumatic brain injury, and he needed to be transferred to a university hospital in Prague to undergo surgery. However, because of Nosek's initial condition, his chances of survival were at 30-50%. In spite of two surgeries, Nosek's condition did not improve. He was transferred to another hospital, and placed on a respirator. He became paralyzed on the right side of his body. The doctor further testified that Nosek is currently in a vegetative state, and may remain in that state for a while, although he is not brain dead. His prognosis, according to the doctor, is very poor. Nosek's mother also testified at the hearing. She said she was worried about Nosek because he was missing from home on February 1, and she was not able to contact him either by phone or by e-mail. They were both huge fans of the band and had seen them at several concerts in Prague. They went to all their concerts in Prague, even though it was a long way for Nosek's parents to go from the town in the mountains. When they heard the concert was being moved to O2 Arena, they decided to go for Nosek's 21st birthday. They went to the concert on February 1, 2013, because Nosek promised his parents that if he was not going to go to the show, they would have to take him to the concert and pick him up. They went to the concert with three friends of Nosek. Nosek had gone to the concert because he had heard that the band was going to do a secret gig at O2 Arena. Nosek had won a ticket for the show in an internet contest, and a chance to meet the band. Nosek's friend was sent to look for Nosek in the crowd during the concert. When he returned he reported that Nosek had a chance to take an autograph from the guitarist. Nosek's friend testified that he did not know whether Nosek would have the chance to take the autograph because the line was so long. After the show had started, a security guard came to Nosek and pushed him, and then he pushed two more people and then the concert had started. His friends tried to bring him out of the crowd. When they got into the elevator, Nosek started complaining about his head, and it took him a long time to get out of the elevator. His friends took him to the hospital, and left him there. Nosek's friend further testified that the security guards had been very aggressive. One of them pushed him twice, and they were very badly dressed. They had jeans, and they were too late. Nosek's friend further testified that a female fan had been raped by a security guard during the concert. He said that his parents had seen Blythe run away from the bodyguards. They got out of the elevator and went to the hotel, but then returned because they heard someone playing the guitar. When they returned, a security guard told them to sit on the floor. Nosek's friend said they wanted to get out of the crowd, and Nosek wanted to get his autograph. The security guard pushed him. The friend also denied any knowledge of any interaction with the band. He said the band had given them three bottles of Jack Daniels. Nosek's father, however, testified that they were not contacted by the band and they never met them. Nosek's father also said that his son had never been in a bar. The hearing has not been concluded at the time of writing. Lamb of God is alleged to be liable for damage caused to Nosek. The band denies the liability and argues that the fans' climbing up the stage was a violation of the contract, which resulted in injury to Nosek. They further argued that they had no way to predict the concert goers' behavior.\n\nHis manager claims that Nosek went into a state of epilepsy and became excited. The defense team further claimed that Nosek was a difficult and at times aggressive person. They claimed that he fought and pulled security guards with him during his fall. Blythe's lawyer said that Blythe was shocked to find a fan climbing on the stage with another fan. The defense argues that the band asked the fans to get down several times, but that they refused to do so. They claim that Nosek had previously been removed from another show and thrown into the crowd.\n\nThe Lamb of God's lawyers tried to convince the judge that Nosek climbed on the stage for the purpose of an autograph. The band denied any knowledge about Nosek. They also denied any knowledge about the security guard who had been accused of raping a fan. The defense team argued that the alleged rape was in contradiction with the contract.\n\nThe plaintiff claims that he never tried to climb on the stage in order to get an autograph from the band members. He said that Blythe had already given him an autograph before the show, and he never knew any members of the band. He denies any knowledge of the autographing line.\n\nThe defendant also claims that the plaintiff asked security guards to help him in order to climb on the stage. He denies any attempt of an autograph. He said that Blythe had never pushed him and that the alleged rape by a security guard never happened.", "watermarked": " \"Blythe was going up the stairs and he was actually holding his guitar on his chest, he was talking to the fans. He was standing there and was talking about how he loves his Czech fans. He was talking and he turned around and looked at Daniel,\" testified Vlach. Blythe, however, told Nosek that he had to get down from the stage. The band members were not dressed in their costumes and were visibly irritated, Vlach further noted. After the break, as the band returned to the stage, another fan from the crowd went on the stage and Blythe, using his guitar, hit the fan in the back. Nosek then tried to talk to Blythe, while Blythe waved him off. At that point, Nosek went to the side of the stage and tried to climb up again, and at that point Blythe gave Nosek a push and he fell off the stage. Vlach testified that Blythe seemed to have had enough energy to kick or punch Nosek, but there were two bodyguards on the stage and one of them was positioned next to Nosek. Nosek was wearing a white T-shirt, and when he fell, his T-shirt got wet in the front. They offered him assistance but he declined, and they called the ambulance. Vlach further testified that Nosek said that Blythe had pushed him after the concert. Vlach and another friend offered to drive him to hospital but Nosek decided to be driven by the ambulance and to cancel the appointment with the band members. He went into coma for four days, and spent three weeks in hospital. Nosek suffered from a brain injury and lost the ability to speak. On February 6, 2013, his father testified that his son was a huge fan of the band and had enjoyed concerts in the Czech Republic for the last seven years. He had never seen anything like this before, he said. Nosek's doctor testified that Nosek's was in a critical state with traumatic brain injury, and he needed to be transferred to a university hospital in Prague to undergo surgery. However, because of Nosek's initial condition, his chances of survival were at 30-50%. In spite of two surgeries, Nosek's condition did not improve. He was transferred to another hospital, and placed on a respirator. He became paralyzed on the right side of his body. The doctor further testified that Nosek is currently in a vegetative state, and may remain in that state for a while, although he is not brain dead. His prognosis, according to the doctor, is very poor. Nosek's mother also testified at the hearing. She said she was worried about Nosek because he was missing from home on February 1, and she was not able to contact him either by phone or by e-mail. They were both huge fans of the band and had seen them at several concerts in Prague. They went to all their concerts in Prague, even though it was a long way for Nosek's parents to go from the town in the mountains. When they heard the concert was being moved to O2 Arena, they decided to go for Nosek's 21st birthday. They went to the concert on February 1, 2013, because Nosek promised his parents that if he was not going to go to the show, they would have to take him to the concert and pick him up. They went to the concert with three friends of Nosek. Nosek had gone to the concert because he had heard that the band was going to do a secret gig at O2 Arena. Nosek had won a ticket for the show in an internet contest, and a chance to meet the band. Nosek's friend was sent to look for Nosek in the crowd during the concert. When he returned he reported that Nosek had a chance to take an autograph from the guitarist. Nosek's friend testified that he did not know whether Nosek would have the chance to take the autograph because the line was so long. After the show had started, a security guard came to Nosek and pushed him, and then he pushed two more people and then the concert had started. His friends tried to bring him out of the crowd. When they got into the elevator, Nosek started complaining about his head, and it took him a long time to get out of the elevator. His friends took him to the hospital, and left him there.

William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth features a fictional character of the same name, who is portrayed as a military general who gradually begins embezzling money from his masters. Macbeth had an insatiable desire to acquire wealth and power, which ultimately led to his downfall. Lord Acton's often quoted phrase, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,\" has become something of a cliche when speaking about people with significant power. A major difference between Macbeth and embezzlers in the modern day is that Macbeth didn't have any true control over his actions. He was manipulated into betraying his country and murdering his king through the use of trickery by his wife. The term \"power corrupts\" is often used to describe people with embezzlement charges. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, the theme of absolute power corrupting absolutely is represented in many ways, through Macbeth's greed for power, his own ambition, and the influence of his wife. The development of the theme of absolute power corrupting absolutely begins with Lady Macbeth's suggestion to Macbeth to kill Duncan in order to take his throne. Lady Macbeth, who is portrayed as a cold and calculating woman, begins to manipulate Macbeth and convince him that it is his duty to become king. The fact that he has to commit murder in order to do so does not seem to bother her. She even compares the murder of Duncan to something as simple as ridding oneself of an old and useless garment. From Lady Macbeth's first words to her husband in the play, we see that she is a woman who is willing to use any means necessary to get what she wants. She is portrayed as someone who is completely in control of her emotions and actions, even when she is confronted with the consequences of her decisions. Her use of the Bible as a justification for murder is a clever ploy to get her husband to do her bidding. As Macbeth's wife, she is used to getting what she wants from her husband, and she is not afraid to use whatever means necessary to get it. However, she is not the only one in the play who is willing to use power corrupting absolute language to get what she wants. As Macbeth's power increases, he begins to feel more and more invincible. He starts to think that he can do no wrong, and he becomes increasingly detached from reality. As his power increases, he becomes more and more isolated from the people around him. He begins to lose touch with what is right and what is wrong, and he begins to lose his humanity. This can be seen in the way that he treats the people who are close to him, such as his wife and his friends. The theme of absolute power corrupting absolutely is also represented in the way that Macbeth begins to see himself as a god. He becomes so confident in his own power that he begins to believe that he can do anything. This can be seen in the way that he begins to refer to himself as a king, and he begins to take on the characteristics of a king. He starts to think that he is above the law, and he begins to believe that he is invincible. This can be seen in the way that he begins to take more and more risks, and he starts to lose his fear of death. The theme of absolute power corrupting absolutely is also represented in the way that Macbeth begins to lose his morality. As he becomes more and more powerful, he begins to believe that he is above the laws of morality. He starts to think that he can do whatever he wants without any consequences. This can be seen in the way that he begins to kill innocent people, and he starts to commit crimes without any regard for the law. This can be seen in the way that he begins to lose his fear of punishment. The theme of absolute power corrupting absolutely is also represented in the way that Macbeth begins to lose his humanity. As he becomes more and more powerful, he begins to lose his empathy and his ability to relate to other people. He starts to see himself as a god, and he starts to believe that he is above all of the laws of the world. This can be seen in the way that he begins to take more and more risks, and he starts to lose his fear of death. This can be seen in the way that he begins to lose his fear of punishment.

{"original": " After their victory, the side travelled to the capital of Queensland, Ipswich, where they won the return match 14\u20138.\n\nAfter their match against Queensland, the New Zealanders returned to Sydney. They played their final three rugby matches there, and each was closely fought. First they faced a selection of players who had played for the side on tour, then New South Wales, and finally Queensland. The team won all three, defeating the first side 11\u20135, the New South Wales selection 13\u20138, and the Queenslanders 17\u201311. These victories over their opponents from New South Wales and Queensland were representative of their dominant record over teams from those states throughout the tour. In all, the New Zealanders played 60 rugby matches on the tour, against teams from England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, Canada and the British colonies of South Africa, New South Wales and Queensland, winning 49 and drawing one match. The only side they failed to beat were England \u2013 both of their games against the English saw them lose.\n\nThe tour began on a high, and on the final match of the tour a significant achievement was realised. At the time, international rugby unions were still officially independent, and one of the issues in the early years of the game was the issue of recognition. Before the 1888\u201389 tour of the British Isles, the only sides recognised as international sides were those from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. As a result, the Australian national team would not be considered by the four British and Irish unions as a proper international side until the first match between them and the first (1882) Australian team, played in 1899. However, many of the teams the New Zealanders faced during the tour of the British Isles were recognised sides. This was a rare example of the New Zealand team achieving recognition for the New Zealand Rugby Union by playing official matches against the recognised unions, and is thus considered the first New Zealand international rugby matches. The matches against Ireland and England were widely considered the most significant matches of the tour.\n\nEven though the matches against England and Ireland were seen as significant, the matches against the English colony of South Africa were much more significant, as they were the first games between the two nations; before the 1891 tour of New Zealand, no formal matches had ever been played between South Africa and New Zealand. The most significant match of the tour was therefore the match against the touring South African team, but they only played them twice, and in both matches the Natives were defeated. The match of greatest significance to the South African team was the final one, and they were victorious in it; as a result, this match was the first between New Zealand and South Africa to be won by South Africa. Nevertheless, the tour of the British Isles was a great success for the New Zealand Rugby Union, and the side's tour of South Africa the following year, while much less successful, resulted in the New Zealand national side gaining official recognition from the South African Rugby Board.\n\nThe 1888\u201389 New Zealand Natives rugby tour of the British Isles and France was the first rugby tour undertaken by a New Zealand representative side. It was organised by a business syndicate consisting of mainly M\u0101ori businessmen and bankers and was intended to boost M\u0101ori tourism in the South Island. The team was not representative of the whole of New Zealand \u2013 several North Island players who had been selected failed to get leave from work or were injured \u2013 and instead consisted of M\u0101ori from the Canterbury and Wellington regions. The side played in both association and rugby football, but as the latter was the more established code in New Zealand at the time, the tour was an effective advertisement for it in Great Britain. The team won 49 of its 60 matches, lost only two (both to England) and drew one. During the tour, the side played official matches against all four of the recognised home nations, and as such, it has been considered the first international rugby matches ever played by New Zealand. As well as the matches against the four home nations, the New Zealanders played a team representing the British colony of South Africa; this was the first time either side had played each other. This tour was the most successful ever undertaken by a rugby side from outside of Great Britain, a record that would stand until the 1905 New Zealand rugby team's \"Original All Blacks\" tour.\n\nFollowing a failed tour of Victoria, Australia, the Natives returned to New Zealand and their tour to South Africa. Despite their poor results against the South African sides on tour, the Natives beat them 9\u20133 in the first ever match between the two nations. The side travelled north, before heading back to New Zealand via Fiji, where they played rugby and association football matches, with the team again preferring the former. They returned to New Zealand in November 1889, and after leaving the island in early 1890, embarked upon the return voyage to Britain, where they arrived on 18 June, playing one more rugby match in London before beginning their return voyage on 22 June. They arrived in New Zealand on 16 July. The tour had generated over \u00a31500 for the side, of which they kept \u00a3500 for the New Zealand Rugby Union and the rest they gave to their sponsors. After returning to New Zealand, they played several matches in both codes of football, and also a second tour of Australia, but after it was over the side was disbanded. The men who played in the tour received almost no compensation for their participation. In the coming years, the New Zealand national team would be officially designated as the All Blacks, although the first time they were officially called this was during the 1896 New Zealand rugby team tour of Australia.\n\nNeed assistance with assignments, homework, or dissertation?

{"original": " An expeditionary force, the 6th Division, was sent to the Middle East in 1940 and fought in the Western Desert and Syria. By the end of 1941 the German advance on Moscow had halted and the threat to the Middle East receded. This allowed the Australian government to replace the 6th Division with 9th Division at the front and the 7th Division in Australia for training. The Australians met with mixed success in combat in the Western Desert Campaign in 1940 and 1941. In 1941 the 7th Division was rushed to Greece and Crete where it again fought successfully against a better-equipped enemy. The loss of Crete was a severe blow to British prestige but did not weaken the Allied position in the Mediterranean. British forces managed to successfully repel the Afrika Korps' first push into Egypt at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, a campaign in which the Australians again distinguished themselves. Later in 1942 and 1943 Australian divisions saw heavy action in New Guinea. The 9th Division, returned from the Middle East, was sent to New Guinea in 1942 and participated in the fighting in the Kokoda Track campaign. At the Battle of Milne Bay the 3rd Division repelled the first attempted Japanese landing on Australian soil, an action which marked the limit of the Japanese advance south in New Guinea. The 7th Division was moved to New Guinea in March 1943 and fought at Wau. Both the 9th and 7th Divisions were withdrawn to Australia in 1943 and 1944 to be rested, and eventually re-equipped with modern weapons, artillery and armoured vehicles, before returning to the fighting in the Pacific. For their actions in the New Guinea campaign of 1942\u20131943, members of the 2/14th Battalion were awarded a total of five Victoria Crosses, four to individual soldiers and one to the battalion as a whole for its part in the Battle of Buna\u2013Gona. From July to September 1942 the Australians also defended Port Moresby in New Guinea during the Battle of the Kokoda Track. The battle saw a Japanese invasion force struggle over the Owen Stanley Ranges to the Australian defensive line, then both sides to the town and finally up the Kokoda Track. The Australians repelled the Japanese attack, and inflicted high casualties on the invading force. The Australians attacked across the Owen Stanley Ranges in September 1942 to recapture Kokoda and a series of successful engagements followed, including Milne Bay, Buna\u2013Gona, Wau, Finschhafen, and the Aitape\u2013Wewak campaign. In September 1942 the Japanese made another attempt to reach Port Moresby, landing 5,000 troops in the Gona area. After landing at Milne Bay in August 1942, the 61st/73rd Infantry Battalion destroyed an advanced Japanese landing force. The Australians repulsed the Japanese at Kokoda in early October and forced them to retreat. The 21st Brigade re-entered Kokoda in November. The 3rd Division then advanced through the Finisterres, forcing the Japanese out of their jungle fortifications and back into the mountains. In June 1944 the 5th Division secured the remnants of the Japanese forces at Aitape on the northern coast of New Guinea. The 8th Division later moved against the remaining Japanese forces in the Hollandia area and in January 1945 the 5th Division defeated the enemy at Wewak, completing the clearing of northern New Guinea.\n\n#### No comments:\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\nComment moderation is enabled.

As the Roughriders' starting running back, McCarty had an impressive rookie season, rushing for over 1,100 yards and earning a selection to the CFL All-Rookie Team. In the 2007 West Division final, McCarty was held to only 17 yards on 13 carries, as the Roughriders lost the game to the Calgary Stampeders.\n\nMcCarty continued his success in 2008, gaining 1,322 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. He earned a spot on the West Division All-Star Team at running back and was the leading vote-getter at the position. In 2009, McCarty had his most productive season yet, breaking the Roughriders' single season rushing record with 1,587 yards. This was good enough for second place in the league, and earned McCarty his second selection to the West Division All-Star Team at running back. After playing only seven games in 2010 due to injury, McCarty suffered a broken leg in the 2011 CFL season opener against the Toronto Argonauts. The injury required surgery and ended his season after only 18 carries. His return to the Roughriders was an immediate success as he rushed for 112 yards in his first game back, and led the Roughriders to their third consecutive West Division title. McCarty had another strong season in 2012, helping Saskatchewan make it to the Grey Cup in both 2010 and 2013. He played five more seasons with Saskatchewan before signing with the Montreal Alouettes in 2017. After three seasons with the Als, McCarty signed with the BC Lions in 2020. His career was disrupted by COVID-19 restrictions, causing him to sit out the 2020 season. He finished his career with the Lions in 2021, gaining 274 rushing yards and two touchdowns in 14 games.

{"original": " He concludes the killer must be the man who abandoned her, and is most likely behind the original murders as well. Olivia and Peter follow a tip from a clerk at the motel, who remembers a man who fled the premises after hearing a child cry, and discover he is Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum). Penrose has a son named Christopher (Derek Cecil) who suffers from rapid aging syndrome, a previously undiscovered and incurable disease that speeds up the aging process, eventually killing the victim. Penrose is able to keep his son alive by injecting him with antifreeze and storing it in cryogenic equipment, but the latest treatments have failed. Christopher, who shares his father's brain, has tapped into Penrose's memories of the murders of the young women, after he began stealing clothes from them in order to live their lives, but he has no recollection of abandoning the mother to die. Olivia and Peter break into Penrose's office and find material from the original murders that shows Penrose has the disease. Christopher has been aware of Penrose's plans to abandon him, and stolen a scalpel to use as a weapon. He attacks his father, resulting in his death. Olivia and Peter return to the hospital to take the boy into custody, but before they can do so, his condition suddenly worsens, and he ages to death as they watch. Walter reveals that Penrose gave him a time capsule, containing a cure for Christopher's condition; but Penrose had shot it with a tranquilizer gun, unaware of its contents. He manages to recover the cure, but learns too late that it was not time-capsule, but Penrose's scalp. Walter concludes that the missing pituitary glands must be extracted from the women and recombined in Christopher. Peter is appalled by the moral implications of the act and refuses to aid Walter, but ultimately gives in after Walter points out Christopher was able to sense him. Walter is able to combine the pituitary glands, and by the end of the episode, Peter reveals that Christopher has come back to life and is better than ever, much to Walter's delight. Olivia accepts an invitation to watch a Cardinals baseball game with John Scott, her former partner from before the \"Pattern\". John walks Olivia to her car at the end of the episode. The scene then cuts to a serial killer's white van driving into a forest as a woman's cell phone rings, playing a rendition of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.\" She answers the phone.

{"original": " The Detroit Free Press stated, \"It's a can't-miss opening salvo, a challenge to the listener as well as an expression of the band's own searching.\" \"[The song] heralds the album's entire ethos, filling the gaping spiritual void with fervent prayer. It's all rock and roll majesty here, but an edge of melancholy and an existential yearning haunt the verses that deliver a rich pop melody.\" Over the years, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" has become the most iconic song from the album and is now the one which is identified the most with the Joshua Tree era and U2. [9] [10] Allmusic ranked it at number 237 on their list of the greatest rock songs of all time, calling the song \"a magical piece of '80s guitar rock\", and noting it as the moment where \"the band became a force to be reckoned with\". [11] Among their readers, Pitchfork Media listed it as the 118th greatest song of the 1980s and 34th greatest song of the 1980s by a band from the UK or Ireland. [12] Rolling Stone listed the song at number 1 on their list of the 100 greatest U2 songs, calling it the \"hymn for a generation\". [13] The publication also ranked it number 13 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time in 2004 and 24 in 2010. [14] In a 2003 BBC World Service poll, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was ranked the second best song ever to feature a guitar riff, only being beaten by The Rolling Stones's \"Start Me Up\". [15] Robert Dimery included \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" in his book 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die, writing that the track \"is U2's anthem, a towering song of love and devotion which also powerfully evokes the immigrant exodus from the Irish countryside in the middle of the 20th century.\" [16] For the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree, in 2017, NME ranked \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" as the third best song from the album, calling it \"a bonafide stadium rock classic\". [17] The song was performed on the band's tours, such as Lovetown Tour and Zoo TV Tour. During the Elevation Tour, the group performed it with a sample of the guitar intro of The Velvet Underground and Nico's \"All Tomorrow's Parties\". The song is included on the albums U218 Singles, The Best of 1980\u20131990, The Joshua Tree, and the live albums Rattle and Hum and Live from Paris. In 2003, the song appeared as a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero. U2 performed it as a medley with \"Breathe\" and \"Streets\" at the 2011 Super Bowl halftime show. That same year, American singer Christina Aguilera covered the song in her album Lotus. A \"World AIDS Day 2015\" video was released on 7 December 2015 in honour of the World AIDS Day on 1 December. It was a collaboration of more than 20 artists and musicians, using 2009 performance from the \"Streets\" medley of U2's Super Bowl performance in 2011. The video featured performance by Josh Groban, Kelly Clarkson, Missy Elliott, Carole King, Herbie Hancock, James Weldon Johnson, Lady Gaga, the National AIDS Memorial, Elton John, Jennifer Hudson, Mary Lambert, Chris Martin, Kim Petras, Cyndi Lauper, P!nk, Ricky Martin, Fun., Barbra Streisand, Kacey Musgraves, Neil Patrick Harris, Demi Lovato, Alicia Keys, Queen Latifah, Shoshana Bean, Lizzo, Ben Platt, Madonna, Shawn Mendes, Paul McCartney, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Kesha, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Troye Sivan, and Wyclef Jean. The video premiered at the 25th Annual AIDF (AIDS for Life) Red Ribbon Awards Gala on 7 December, in recognition of the 35th World AIDS Day. It was aired on NBC on 12 December as part of the song \"One World\", the charity single from Aguilera's album, Lotus. The song was released as a music video in its own right. According to Billboard, the song was a top-ten hit in several territories. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, the song peaked at number 6. The song was the first top ten song from U2's first compilation album The Best of 1980\u20131990. In the United Kingdom, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1998. The song reached the top five in Denmark, Iceland, and Spain. In Finland, the song charted at number 7, in France at number 10, in the Netherlands at number 12, and in Sweden at number 14. In New Zealand, the song charted at number 18, and in Ireland it reached number 28. In 2011, the song reached a peak of number 18 on the French Singles Chart as a result of its appearance in an advert for French cosmetics brand Guerlain. In 2012, it entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 86, becoming their 21st top 40 single in the country and the third-highest debut by a veteran artist that year. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" became the second consecutive single from their The Best of 1980\u20131990, following \"Desire\", to chart on the Hot 100. [18] Two years later, the song peaked at number 17 in the Hot 100 in its own right. It was certified platinum in 1998 and platinum in 2017 by the Recording Industry Association of America, the latter in recognition of the song being streamed over one billion times.

{"original": " Science Advisor David Hartman, executive story editor Jeff Pinkner, and executive producer Josh Singer aided the writing staff in making the episode as scientifically accurate as possible. Singer revealed the \"pinhole\" effect seen in the episode is a concept that had been introduced in the previous episode, \"The Arrival\". Although the episode's scripts revealed the return of supporting cast member Phillip Winneberg, the actor's name was never spoken in the episode. Similarly, a female lab technician, previously played by Tricia Helfer, was absent from the episode. J. J. Abrams explained that he was originally slated to direct \"The Same Old Story\", but was unable to do so and recommended Paul A. Edwards as a possible replacement. Paul A. Edwards directed a second unit on Fringe. The episode marked his first time directing an hour-long show. An issue arose while filming the episode when the show's practical effects crew set up a smoke machine on the bridge that was not supposed to be operating during the day's scenes. The mistake resulted in the entire set getting covered in smoke, which was then subsequently removed from the episode in post-production. Pinkner felt the dialogue needed to \"run right on the edge of plausibility\". The title of the episode was inspired by a book by Michael Connelly. Abrams said that the writers and directors of the show are also fans of TV shows and movies with similar themes to Fringe and, like him, like to get references to those shows and movies into the show. This episode is a reference to the 1991 movie The Silence of the Lambs. Abrams used the series premiere to introduce other visual motifs, and the episode establishes a number of patterns and behaviors in Olivia and the show's antagonists. \"The Same Old Story\" was broadcast by Fox in the United States on September 9, 2008. Critical reaction was mostly positive. Chris Carabott of IGN praised the episode's mystery element. The site's critic, Ramsey Isler, thought the episode had an engaging story, but ultimately found the twist ending lacking. Oliver Sava of the Chicago Reader compared the episode's conflict to ABC's The Mentalist, and enjoyed the series' exploration of mysterious symbols and concepts, as well as the references to the film The Silence of the Lambs. The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert recommended the episode, praising the mystery, Olivia's character development, and calling Walter \"a formidable mixture of warmth and strangeness\". The San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman agreed, calling the series \"smart\", and \"not heavy-handed, or pedantic, but it offers enough intrigue and backstory to keep one interested\". Reviewers for Variety and The Hollywood Reporter also gave positive reviews of the episode. The former, reviewing the pilot and two other episodes, said Fringe had a \"long and hard road ahead\" to be successful, but said the pilot was a \"sound, promising start\" and that the show had a \"good sense of pacing and style\", and good action. Rick Porter of Zap2it also praised the series' initial outing, but said it would need to do more to separate itself from rival series The Mentalist, a show with a similar tone. Porter praised the episode's direction, while Zap2it's Geoff Berkshire thought it lacked excitement. The A.V. Club gave \"The Same Old Story\" a grade of \"A\", praising the mysteries and characterizations.

{"original": " It was noted that the weight of windshafs had increased from 110 lb to 110 lb (50 to 49 kg), without making any further deductions for possible wear on the teeth of the tail wheel. All eight bearings were repaired, with two new stock, two new windshaft and two new nave bearings being made. All four windshaft bearings were repaired. Two new nave bearings, one for each stock, were also made. When these were inserted the mill was found to run freely, and without wear. The tail wheel was repaired and the toothed drive was replaced. New stocks were made and the new stock for the inner stock fitted. This was installed and tested. One of the nave bearings for the outer stock had been incorrectly made and this stock was fitted, but with no windshaft bearings being used. The second stock was then fitted and tested, but only using a single windshaft bearing. With the bearings of the two stocks being used in isolation from one another, a running difference was noticed and it was found that the two wheels did not run in unison. The mill thus did not work and was left with the stocks in their temporary positions. A week later, in an effort to discover the problem, one of the windshaft bearings was also omitted. This resulted in a smoother running of the mill, and now the two stocks were in unison with one another. It was assumed that the problem was thus related to the wheel bearings, and that the bearings were incorrectly made for one of the stocks. New stock and nave bearings were made to replace those now being replaced. Two new stock and nave bearings were made to replace the two original stock and nave bearings. The original stock and nave bearings were used to make the new stock and nave bearings. The wheel bearings were thus now correct for both stocks and the new ones were fitted. With all four bearings in use, the mill ran at its correct speed for the first time. After the sails were finally finished, the mill was tested again. Now the sails were found to be too large and caused too much wear on the drive. A smaller pitch was therefore needed. It was therefore decided that the sails would be reduced in size to a medium pitch. The sails were trimmed to the smaller size and put back up. The mill ran well.", "watermarked": " It was noted that the weight of windshafs had increased from 110 lb to 110 lb (50 to 49 kg), without making any further deductions for possible wear on the teeth of the tail wheel. All eight bearings were repaired, with two new stock, two new windshaft and two new nave bearings being made. All four windshaft bearings were repaired. Two new nave bearings, one for each stock, were also made. When these were inserted the mill was found to run freely, and without wear. The tail wheel was repaired and the toothed drive was replaced. New stocks were made and the new stock for the inner stock fitted. This was installed and tested. One of the nave bearings for the outer stock had been incorrectly made and this stock was fitted, but with no windshaft bearings being used. The second stock was then fitted and tested, but only using a single windshaft bearing. With the bearings of the two stocks being used in isolation from one another, a running difference was noticed and it was found that the two wheels did not run in unison. The mill thus did not work and was left with the stocks in their temporary positions. A week later, in an effort to discover the problem, one of the windshaft bearings was also omitted. This resulted in a smoother running of the mill, and now the two stocks were in unison with one another. It was assumed that the problem was thus related to the wheel bearings, and that the bearings were incorrectly made for one of the stocks. New stock and nave bearings were made to replace those now being replaced. Two new stock and nave bearings were made to replace the two original stock and nave bearings. The original stock and nave bearings were used to make the new stock and nave bearings. The wheel bearings were thus now correct for both stocks and the new ones were fitted. With all four bearings in use, the mill ran at its correct speed for the first time. After the sails were finally finished, the mill was tested again. Now the sails were found to be too large and caused too much wear on the drive. A smaller pitch was therefore needed. It was therefore decided that the sails would be reduced in size to a medium pitch. The sails were trimmed to the smaller size and put back up. The mill ran well."}

{"original": " In July 3 RAR returned to Australia, but was replaced by 1 RAR and elements of 4 RAR. A second 4 RAR Battalion Group was deployed later in 1965, but after that no further Australian infantry units were committed to Borneo. At the end of 1965, the number of Commonwealth units had been reduced, and the whole of Borneo was divided into four sectors, each under the command of a Brigade headquarters from either Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom. Under new instructions from the British High Command, all units were given a defensive role and limited offensive operations. As the military confrontation subsided, in September 1965 the Australian force was reduced from five infantry battalions to two, comprising a third battalion group of 4 RAR and a company group from 2 RAR. 4 RAR had its third rotation of troops in May 1966, with 2 RAR following in August. On 1 September 1966, following a general election in Australia, a new government of which the Labor Party was a part of came into power and decided to withdraw the Australian forces. All the Australian infantry troops were withdrawn from Borneo by January 1967. On 11 August 1966, Major Ron Ramsey from 2 RAR was killed by Indonesian forces, the only Australian soldier to be killed during the campaign. A total of 602 Australian personnel served on the campaign, of whom 12 were killed and 27 wounded. They were awarded 12 decorations for bravery. Australian casualties from this campaign are included in the War Dead Roll of Honour. Australian military historians agree that the most significant task performed by Australia in the confrontation was the undertaking of reconnaissance and surveillance missions in the Australian area of operations. These were conducted by small reconnaissance patrols in the field supported by a series of listening posts and small base groups. By early 1966, the Australians had built a chain of listening posts across their area of operations and were achieving good intelligence results from these activities. It was largely through these reconnaissance activities that intelligence relating to Indonesian troop dispositions and preparations was obtained. The surveillance operations were particularly useful in building up intelligence on the movements of Indonesian patrols and of the positions and likely operations of main Indonesian forces. The Australian units continued to perform their other roles, providing infantry units for security operations in Sarawak and Sabah, conducting regular operations to hold the contact line, and conducting cross-border raids. Australia also provided some troops to act as security guards for Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, during a visit to Borneo in February 1966. While the Australian force remained in Borneo the Indonesian incursions never ceased and they were still a source of tension. However, the Australians made little attempt to cover all of the Indonesian frontier with troops, relying on reconnaissance patrols and static listening posts for early warning. The Australians continued to perform the tasks assigned to them, although the confrontation was never an Australian priority. Despite this, the Australians provided a valuable contribution to the Allied force in Borneo. When the Indonesians indicated that they were ready to talk peace, the Australians joined in the negotiations and contributed a small number of their forces to the Allied monitoring and patrolling group.\n\nVeteran continued with my plan to go back to school and studied BCA on open entry.

A second 4 RAR Battalion Group was deployed later in 1965, but after that no further Australian infantry units were committed to Borneo. At the end of 1965, the number of Commonwealth units had been reduced, and the whole of Borneo was divided into four sectors, each under the command of a Brigade headquarters from either Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom. Under new instructions from the British High Command, all units were given a defensive role and limited offensive operations. As the military confrontation subsided, in September 1965 the Australian force was reduced from five infantry battalions to two, comprising a third battalion group of 4 RAR and a company group from 2 RAR. 4 RAR had its third rotation of troops in May 1966, with 2 RAR following in August. On 1 September 1966, following a general election in Australia, a new government of which the Labor Party was a part of came into power and decided to withdraw the Australian forces. All the Australian infantry troops were withdrawn from Borneo by January 1967. On 11 August 1966, Major Ron Ramsey from 2 RAR was killed by Indonesian forces, the only Australian soldier to be killed during the campaign. A total of 602 Australian personnel served on the campaign, of whom 12 were killed and 27 wounded. They were awarded 12 decorations for bravery. Australian casualties from this campaign are included in the War Dead Roll of Honour. Australian military historians agree that the most significant task performed by Australia in the confrontation was the undertaking of reconnaissance and surveillance missions in the Australian area of operations. These were conducted by small reconnaissance patrols in the field supported by a series of listening posts and small base groups. By early 1966, the Australians had built a chain of listening posts across their area of operations and were achieving good intelligence results from these activities. It was largely through these reconnaissance activities that intelligence relating to Indonesian troop dispositions and preparations was obtained. The surveillance operations were particularly useful in building up intelligence on the movements of Indonesian patrols and of the positions and likely operations of main Indonesian forces. The Australian units continued to perform their other roles, providing infantry units for security operations in Sarawak and Sabah, conducting regular operations to hold the contact line, and conducting cross-border raids. Australia also provided some troops to act as security guards for Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, during a visit to Borneo in February 1966. While the Australian force remained in Borneo the Indonesian incursions never ceased and they were still a source of tension. However, the Australians made little attempt to cover all of the Indonesian frontier with troops, relying on reconnaissance patrols and static listening posts for early warning. The Australians continued to perform the tasks assigned to them, although the confrontation was never an Australian priority. Despite this, the Australians provided a valuable contribution to the Allied force in Borneo. When the Indonesians indicated that they were ready to talk peace, the Australians joined in the negotiations and contributed a small number of their forces to the Allied monitoring and patrolling group.\n\nVeteran continued with my plan to go back to school and studied BCA on open entry.

{"original": " A significant proportion of the troops were of Muslim origin. They were accompanied by quite a few Chinese as well. These Chinese and foreign soldiers clearly outnumbered the native peoples of the region. These foreign soldiers fought bravely for the Mongols, as will be shown by the following three stories, taken from the Yuan Shi, the Official History of the Mongols.The first story describes the defense of Yingjiang against a Burmese attack. The Burmese forces came in three armies, the first two being the vanguard. They had been fighting for some days without achieving much, so the Mongols in the city sent a senior Chinese general, Mu Chengshun, to attack the last of the three armies. Chengshun saw that it was a bad idea to confront the enemies by himself, so he recruited some Han Chinese (ex-Song) soldiers who had surrendered, and then selected some reliable Mongol guards. He put them in a forward position to fight the enemy while he went to the rear to help train the local levies. They went through the plan twice. He was just finishing the training, and the food had not arrived, when he heard that the enemy was already pressing on the rear. He ordered the cavalry to attack, while he went to the front of the men he had recruited. He wanted to stop the fighting so that he could reorganize the men. But by the time he arrived, most of the troops were dead, and the survivors could not stand the pressure. Seeing this, he forgot all about saving the town and went to help the soldiers who were still holding their position. He took command of the center position, sending some soldiers to reinforce the right and left flanks, while he himself continued to command the center. The flanks could not withstand the enemy's onslaught. Some of the soldiers who had escaped from the center joined the flanks and fortified their position. Mu Chengshun himself fought with them, until he saw that they were about to lose their position. In this way, the defenders lost their center and both flanks. When they retreated to the gate of the city, Chengshun put some officers in charge of holding the gate. Then he ordered some soldiers to organize into four ranks, and then organized them again to charge at the enemy. Seeing that this maneuver was out of the ordinary, the enemies held back. Chengshun led his soldiers to defeat them. The battle ended. He took the position that had been lost, took some prisoners, and sent the news back to the city. The governor of the city was not at all pleased with him. Mu Chengshun asked him, \"I don't know whether I should be killed or not.\" He immediately beheaded the soldiers who had deserted their position, and then beheaded the deserters himself. He burnt the bodies and fed them to dogs. The Burmese army also beat a retreat.The second story describes the battle of the Han and Li Rivers. After the border war ended, the Burmese and Mongol armies both withdrew. But both sides were full of distrust. Burmese agents sent by Pagan and Xiancheng to attack some Mongol soldiers at Puping (in modern Luxi County, Yunnan), and fought the Mongols at Longtian (modern Ruili, Yunnan), where they had also stationed some troops. Thus, the Mongols saw the need to strengthen the garrison. The plan was to build a garrison at the entrance to the Burmese territory at the junction of the Han and Li Rivers, so that the enemies would have to pass through a narrow pass. Also, the area of the Han and Li Rivers would be the most effective in deterring attacks against the capital, Puping. To gain confidence of the local chiefs, the Mongols selected men from among the local residents as leaders. At first, they came with their families. But soon the Burmese army came and attacked the Mongol troops. Since they had heard of the Burmese army's military power, the Mongol leaders became panicked and started to slip away from the battle field. The soldiers also saw their leaders slipping away and became worried. After seeing this, a local chief from Longtian came and begged the soldiers to listen to him. Then he said, \"A hero does not run away from the battle field. Even if he dies, he can become an immortal.\" He went back to Longtian and gathered together the people of Longtian. He also recruited some Han Chinese and other foreign soldiers who were in the region. He asked them to wait until the Burmese attacked. They did not allow the Burmese to enter the town, but instead, all came to fight the Burmese at the entrance to the town. They broke through the ranks of the enemies, and saw that there were only about a thousand of them, and their leader was sitting on a deer. The chief of Longtian called them \"the enemies of the Mongols\". He ordered his men to surround the enemy. As a result, the Burmese leader died. The chief of Longtian then asked the Han Chinese soldiers to form four lines, and directed his own men to be the front line. Then he ordered them to advance, and the enemies retreated. The soldiers kept after them, but the enemies went up the Li River, and then turned to the Han River. The Mongols caught up with them at the Han River. They put all the soldiers in two lines, one at the river and one above the river, and did not allow the Burmese to pass through. The Burmese finally ran away. The Burmese king immediately reported to the Song that the Mongols had conscripted native residents to defend the region, and asked the Song government to fight back against the conscripted soldiers. The Song court did not know the details of the military situation, so it did not take any action. When the king of Pagan found out, he immediately came with another army to attack the border area. His army met the Mongols, and they fought one another until the Burmese army retreated. The governor of the border region asked the court to reinforce the army, so the military commissioner of Yunnan sent some generals to the border area. At that time, the Mongol governors in the region of the Han and Li Rivers came to join forces with each other. They attacked the enemies again and killed the leading generals of the Burmese army. They even killed some of the local chiefs of the enemies. They also killed many of the enemies in battle. Seeing this, the king of Pagan had to retreat.The third story describes the battle of a village called Jiangnan, and is similar to the first story. The Burmese came to Jiangnan and occupied the village. The Mongols soon sent reinforcements and defeated the enemy. At the time, the people in the village did not have any food, so the governor of the border region helped them with provisions. Seeing that the Mongols did not do anything to hurt the people of the village, the chief of Jiangnan went to the Mongol general with his relatives and asked to help them fight the enemy. When he said that, the general laughed at him. He said, \"When you came to the village,", "watermarked": " A significant proportion of the troops were of Muslim origin. They were accompanied by quite a few Chinese as well. These Chinese and foreign soldiers clearly outnumbered the native peoples of the region. These foreign soldiers fought bravely for the Mongols, as will be shown by the following three stories, taken from the Yuan Shi, the Official History of the Mongols.The first story describes the defense of Yingjiang against a Burmese attack. The Burmese forces came in three armies, the first two being the vanguard. They had been fighting for some days without achieving much, so the Mongols in the city sent a senior Chinese general, Mu Chengshun, to attack the last of the three armies.

{"original": " The Chinese described them as sparsely populated and inhabited by wild tribes, among which they included the Burmese. Dali Kingdom c. 1200. Note the southwestern outpost at Mogaung, near today's Mansi border town. The Dali Kingdom, now being called the Mogaung Kingdom (after its southwestern outpost, present-day Mansi), was a residual of the Dali Kingdom of the Song period. Its core territory was now smaller (the Dali region alone). It also held sway over the newly acquired lands in present-day Yunnan, including the Mongol-held territory to the north. The Mongol Emperor of China sent a long letter to the Mogaung ruler in the late 1270s, after the Mongols had secured their occupation of Yunnan. It told him to: \"surrender and submit to the Great Khan, change his name and throw off his old customs and adopt new ways, turn Buddhist and abandon Shamanism.\" Mongol envoy Hashatu and Han Chinese Baisimu visited the Mogaung king at his capital, Lincang. The Mongols quickly realized that the Burmese were able to build a navy of 700 warships to counter the Mongol invasion.\n\nThe Pagan Empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301. Marco Polo reported the first invasions (1277\u201387) in his travelogue, Il Milione. The Burmese referred to the invaders as the Taruk (after the central Asian Turkic troops that largely made up the Mongol invasion army); today, the term Taruk () refers to the Han Chinese instead. King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in Burmese history as Taruk-Pye Min, (\"the King who Fled from the Taruk\"). In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Chinese described them as sparsely populated and inhabited by wild tribes, among which they included the Burmese. Dali Kingdom c. 1200. Note the southwestern outpost at Mogaung, near today's Mansi border town. The Dali Kingdom, now being called the Mogaung Kingdom (after its southwestern outpost, present-day Mansi), was a residual of the Dali Kingdom of the Song period. Its core territory was now smaller (the Dali region alone). It also held sway over the newly acquired lands in present-day Yunnan, including the Mongol-held territory to the north. The Mongol Emperor of China sent a long letter to the Mogaung ruler in the late 1270s, after the Mongols had secured their occupation of Yunnan. It told him to: \"surrender and submit to the Great Khan, change his name and throw off his old customs and adopt new ways, turn Buddhist and abandon Shamanism.\" Mongol envoy Hashatu and Han Chinese Baisimu visited the Mogaung king at his capital, Lincang.

The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301. Marco Polo reported the first invasions (1277\u201387) in his travelogue, Il Milione. The Burmese referred to the invaders as the Taruk (after the central Asian Turkic troops that largely made up the Mongol invasion army); today, the term Taruk () refers to the Han Chinese instead.
